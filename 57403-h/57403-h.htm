<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">MY</span> <i>attempt at an
English rendering
of the Letters
is, I think,
the first since the
days of Bowles’
‘Letters from a Portuguese
Nun to an Officer in the
French Army,’ London, 1808.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
But during the two centuries
which have elapsed since their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
first publication quite a small
literature has grown up around
them, and they have been turned
into several European tongues,
the French editions alone
amounting to more than thirty.
If the numerous so-called
‘Replies’ and ‘Imitations’
were added to this reckoning
the number would be nearly
doubled, and this without taking
into account the critiques
and studies which have appeared
about them. I do not
propose here to enter into
a comparison of the Letters
with those of Heloïse, as many
writers have done, but shall
content myself with referring
the curious to the excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
work of Senhor Cordeiro, ‘<span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Soror
Marianna. A Freira Portugueza</span>,’
Lisbon, 1888; 2nd
edition, 1891. It is from him
that I have learnt nearly all
that I know about Marianna,
and in my Introduction I have
made a liberal use of his book,
as well as of M. Asse’s preface
to the edition of the ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lettres
Portuguises avec les Réponses</span>,’
Paris, 1889, upon which I
have based my rendering.</i></p>

<p><i>If my translation should
arouse any interest in things
Portuguese, and lead others to
read and make versions of such
masterpieces of the world’s
literature as the ‘<span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Frei Luiz
de Sousa</span>’ and the ‘<span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">Folhas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
Cahidas</span>’ of Garrett, or the
poems of João de Deus, I
should be more than rewarded
for any trouble the present
work may have cost me. But
who can hope to succeed where
Burton has apparently failed?
The English public&mdash;and the
critics too&mdash;will probably continue
to believe that there
is nothing worth reading in
Portuguese literature with the
exception of the Lusiads. Here
too there is perhaps a lesson
to be learnt from the Germans,
especially from such as
Storck, Reinhardstoettner, and
Michaëlis de Vasconcellos.</i></p>

<p><i>I should like to thank Mr.
York Powell of Christ Church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
for the kind help which he has
given me in the difficult task
of translation. My aim has
been throughout to keep as
close to the French text as possible&mdash;seeing
that the original
Portuguese is lost,&mdash;aided by
the masterly re-translation of
Senhor Cordeiro. L’Estrange’s
version&mdash;‘Five Love Letters
from a Nun to a Cavalier,’
London, 1678,&mdash;is somewhat
free at times, but it has aided
me in the Third Letter. I have
followed Cordeiro in his re-arrangement
of the order of
the Letters, the Second and
Fourth changing places.</i></p>

<p><i>The historical facts which
concern the hero and heroine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
of these Letters I have given
briefly in the Introduction,
and a Bibliography and
Appendix will be found at
the end of the volume. The
text of the first French edition
of 1669 has been copied in
Paris purposely for this work,
and will, it is hoped, add much
to its interest and value.</i></p>

<p><i>And so I deliver poor Marianna’s
passionate Epistles to
the consideration of those who
can appreciate them and feel
for her.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">
‘IN</span> 1663,’ says Sainte-Beuve,
‘it became
the policy of Louis
<span class="smcap lowercase">XIV.</span> to help Portugal
against Spain, but
the succour which
he gave was indirect;
subsidies were secretly furnished,
the levying of troops was favoured,
and a crowd of volunteers hastened
there. Between this small army, commanded
by Schomberg, and the feeble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Spanish troops which disputed the soil
with it, there were each summer many
marches and counter-marches with but
few results, many skirmishes and small
fights, and among the latter, perhaps, one
victory. Who troubles himself about
it now? The curious reader, however,
who only looks to his own pleasure,
cannot help saying that all this was
good, since the “Letters of the Portuguese
Nun” grew from it.</p>

<p>As Sainte-Beuve indicates, the subject
of the ‘Letters’ forms one of the episodes
of the war between Spain and Portugal
which followed as a consequence of the
Restoration of 1640 and the achievement
of the latter’s independence under
the House of Braganza. This war,
which lasted for twenty-eight years,
until the final peace in 1668, was intermittent,
and carried on only at long
intervals owing to the state of the two
contending parties. Spain had now
entered on the period of her decline,
and Portugal was in a hardly better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
condition after her sixty years’ captivity
and the exhaustion of her forces which
had taken place during the reign of
Philip IV. Owing, however, to the aid
of France, she had been enabled to hold
her own up to 1659; but the news of the
Peace of the Pyrenees seemed at first
to take from her all hope of preserving
her hardly won autonomy. Yet in
spite of this, Mazarin, while signing the
clause which bound France to abandon
the Portuguese cause, determined, with
his usual duplicity, that this should not
prevent him from secretly aiding an ally
whom he had found so useful in the
past as a thorn in the side of Spain.
Hardly, indeed, had the treaty been
made than he began to occupy himself
in recruiting for the Portuguese service
a number of French officers whom the
peace had left without employment.
Among these the chief was Schomberg,
who went to Lisbon in 1660 as commander-in-chief
and to reorganise the
Portuguese army. It was not, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
until 1663 that the hero of the Letters,
Noel Bouton, afterwards Marquis of
Chamilly and St. Leger, arrived in the
country, which he was to leave four
years later with the betrayal of a poor
nun as his title to fame. For at the
time when Schomberg was already there,
we see Chamilly (as he is generally
called) assisting at the marriage of his
brother to Catherine le Comte de Nonant,
referred to in the text (Letter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>).</p>

<p>Three years afterwards, finding himself
without military employment in
France, he came to Portugal, attracted
probably, like so many others, by the
reputation of the great captain, with
whom he had doubtless established
friendly relations during the campaign in
Flanders (1656-8).</p>

<p>Our hero, if hero he may be called,
was the eleventh son of Nicholas Bouton,
Lord of Chamilly, Charangeroux, and,
later on, St. Leger, properties of modest
size in Burgundy. His family was good,
but its attachment to the Princes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Condé during the Fronde had compromised
its position and damaged its
fortunes. Noel, the future marquis,
was born in 1636, and as soon as his
age allowed he entered on a military
career. He served through the Flanders
campaign under Turenne, and in 1658
was made captain, under the name of
the Count of Chamilly, in Mazarin’s
regiment of cavalry. Reaching Portugal
at the end of 1663, or the commencement
of 1664, he was given the same
rank in a regiment commanded by a
French officer of note, Briquemault.
Although his name is not mentioned in
any of the contemporary notices of the
war, we know that he was present at the
Siege of Valença de Alcantara (June
1664), at the battle of Castello Rodrigo
(in the same month and year), at that of
Montes Claros (June 1665), and at the
principal sieges which occupied the next
two years. In 1665, he was promoted
to the rank of colonel, and two years
later a diploma of Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XIV.</span>, issued,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
perhaps, at the instance of his brother,
the Governor of Dijon, gave Chamilly
a similar post in the French army, with
the evident intention of enabling him to
leave the Portuguese service when he
liked, even though the war with Spain
should not be ended. This, taken together
with the fact that in the document
the space for the month is left
blank, is extremely significant, and, as
will be seen later on, certainly connects
itself with the episode of the ‘Letters,’
even if it does not enter into their actual
history.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The diploma of Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XIV.</span>,
it may be added, is dated 1667, and the
sudden departure of Chamilly took place
at the end of that year, so that it seems
probable that the French captain, fearing
future annoyance or even danger to
himself from his <i>liaison</i>, had determined
to secure a safe retreat.</p>

<p>But let us look for a moment at the
authoress of the famous ‘Portuguese
Letters.’</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>
<p>Marianna Alcoforado was born of a
good family in the city of Beja and
province of Alemtejo in the year 1640.
Her father appears to us in the first
years of the Restoration as a man in an
influential position, well related, and discharging
important commissions both
administrative and political. He possessed
a large agricultural property, which
he administered with attention and even
zeal, and was a Cavalier of the Order of
Christ, besides being intimate with some
of the principal men of the time. He
had six children, of whom Marianna,
according to Cordeiro, was the second.
Life in Beja at that time seems to have
been sufficiently insecure, owing to the
fact that the province of which it was
one of the chief cities formed the theatre
of the war, and Beja itself was the
chief garrison town. Tumults were constantly
arising from quarrels between the
various parts of the heterogeneous mass
which then composed the Portuguese
army, and hence increased care would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
be necessary on the part of Francisco
Alcoforado in order that the education
of his daughters might be conducted in
such a manner as their position demanded.
Hence, too, probably, the reason
why Marianna and her sister Catherine
entered the Convent of the Conception
at an earlier age than was usual. Their
father, occupied with administrative and
military work on the frontier, would be
unable to give them the oversight and
attention which quieter times would
have allowed.</p>

<p>The Convent of the Conception at
Beja was founded in 1467 by the parents
of King Emanuel the Fortunate, and,
favoured successively by royal and private
devotion, it had become one of the
most important and wealthy institutions
of its kind in Portugal. It was situated
at the extreme south of the city, near to
the ancient walls, and looked on to the
gates still called ‘of Mertola,’ because
they are on the side of the city towards
Mertola, distant fifty-four kilometres to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the south-west on the right bank of the
Guadiana. There is still to be seen the
remains of the balcony or verandah from
which Marianna first caught sight of
Chamilly, probably during some military
evolutions (cf. Letter <span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span>), and from it a
good view may be obtained over the
plains of Alemtejo as they stretch away
to the south. Curiously enough, the
tradition of Marianna and her fatal love
has been perpetuated in the convent, in
spite of the attempts, natural enough, on
the part of monastic chroniclers and
such like to hide all traces of it.</p>

<p>In this as in most other convents
there were two kinds of cells&mdash;the dormitories,
divided into cubicles, and rooms
forming independent abodes dispersed
throughout the edifice. These latter the
nuns of the seventeenth century called
their ‘houses,’&mdash;<i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">as suas casas</i>,&mdash;and it was
one of these which Marianna possessed.
The former were in accordance with the
Constitutions, while the latter, though
strictly forbidden, nevertheless existed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
These separate abodes were, it is true,
often necessitated by the growth of the
convent population, and generally appertained
to nuns of a better position, while
the dormitories served for those who
were either poorer or of an inferior rank.
Many of these <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">casas</i>, too, were built by
private individuals who had some connection
or other with the particular
convent, and there are indications that
the father of Marianna had caused some
to be erected in that of the Conception.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>From the year 1665 to 1667, then,
Beja was, as we have said, the centre of
the various military movements in which
Chamilly took part under the leadership
of Schomberg, and there is no doubt
that he spent much of his time there.
Marianna was twenty-five years old. She
had been intrusted to the Cloister when
a child,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> as she herself tells us, and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
renunciation of the world must have
been little more than a form. She had
probably made her ‘profession’ too at
the age of sixteen, that provided for by
the Constitutions, if not at an earlier date.</p>

<p>The dull routine of her life was suddenly
broken in upon by the sight of a
man surrounded with all the prestige of
military glory&mdash;one who was the first to
awaken in her a consciousness of her
own beauty&mdash;the first to tell her that he
loved her, one, moreover, who was ready
to throw all his greatness, his present
and his future, at her feet.</p>

<p>‘I was young; I was trustful. I had
been shut up in this convent since my
childhood. I had only seen people whom
I did not care for. I had never heard
the praises which you constantly gave
me. Methought I owed you the charms
and the beauty which you found in me,
and which you were the first to make
me perceive. I heard you well talked
of; every one spoke in your favour. You
did all that was necessary to awaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
love in me.’<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Such is her simple confession,
and, comments Cordeiro, nothing
more natural.</p>

<p>Their first meeting was probably due
to the relations which Chamilly, an
officer of rank, had entered into with the
Alcoforados, one of the chief families in
Beja. There are indications, indeed,
that Chamilly and Marianna’s eldest
brother had met, doubtless in the field,
for the latter also followed the profession
of arms; and this brother, named Balthazar
Vaz Alcoforado, is probably the
same as the ‘brother’ referred to in the
Letters as the lovers’ go-between. It was
for his benefit that Marianna’s father had
striven for years to build up an estate
which was to be entailed on his offspring.
But in the year 1669, just at the very
time of the great sensation caused by
the publication of the Letters in Paris,
Balthazar abandoned his military career
and all his brilliant prospects in the
world to enter the priesthood. It is im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>possible
not to hazard a guess, although
we know nothing for certain on the
point, that his motive for so doing was
connected in some way with the almost
tragic ending of the <i>liaison</i> between
his sister and the French captain. But
to return:&mdash;The customs of the time,
curiously enough, allowed a greater
relative liberty to nuns as regards the
visits which might be paid them than to
married women,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> or, as the Bishop of
Gram Para puts it, ‘the liberty of the
grating was wide in those miserable
times.’<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>We cannot of course be expected
to give an account of the progress of
this <i>liaison</i>, nor do we wish to indulge
in romantic hypotheses.</p>

<p>Chamilly was thirty at the time when
he first saw Marianna. Brought up as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
he had been to war as a trade, a man of
small intelligence and few scruples, the
intrigue would be a pleasant diversion, a
means <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pour passer le temps</i> which he
would otherwise have found dull enough
in a Portuguese provincial town after the
Paris of ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Grand Monarque</span>.’ The
seduction and desertion of a poor nun
must have seemed all so perfectly natural
to one brought up in contact with the
loose morality of camp life and in the
France of Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XIV.</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In June 1667 the authorities of Beja
received an answer from the new King,
Don Pedro, to the complaint which they
had made of ‘the oppression which the
French cavalry continued to exercise on
this people.’<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Already, on account of
similar complaints, Schomberg had been
ordered to move his cavalry from the
town and district, but he had disobeyed
these orders for strategic reasons. Now,
we have already seen that it was between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
1665 and 1667 that Chamilly carried on
his intrigue with Marianna, and it is just
in 1667 that the scandal must have
attained greater proportions, coinciding
with and ending, not in the withdrawal
of the French cavalry, but in the sudden
retirement of Chamilly to France. But
what, it may be asked, was the reason
for the King’s order, and what could
those ‘oppressions’ have been in an
important city where presumably there
was a regular and well-appointed police
administration? Has it not a relation,
asks Cordeiro, with the incident in the
‘Letters,’ which would both afflict and
irritate the influential family of the nun
and the good burgesses of Beja? The
special situation of the French captain,
on the other hand&mdash;his interest in not
aggravating the scandal, and the peril
for the religious herself in the adoption
of violent means, would all naturally
counsel the withdrawal of Chamilly.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The danger of remaining longer in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Beja was not in the nature of those
which the French colonel could confront
with his recognised courage. If he were
surprised in the convent, if he were
denounced as its violator and as the
seducer of a nun, the daughter of a well-known
family, and one, too, which was
on excellent terms with the new sovereign,
neither his own position nor the
protection of Schomberg would avail
him, since both the one and the other
began to lose their importance with the
approach of peace.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>However this may be, certain it is
that Chamilly’s own excuses for departure,
referred to in the ‘Letters,’ were
merely empty pretexts, and a reference
to the history of the time will show
this. If Louis <span class="smcap lowercase">XIV.</span> needed his presence
so much for the invasion of Franche
Comté, why not, it may be asked, for
the important campaign in Flanders in
1667?</p>

<p>He seems to have left Portugal, too, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
little clandestinely, for no notice is to be
met with, as in the case of other French
officers, of his asking and obtaining leave
from the Portuguese Government, and
he probably did not even embark in
Lisbon. Already, in the beginning of
February 1668, we find him with Louis
<span class="smcap lowercase">XIV.</span> in Dijon, so that he must have
quitted Beja and the seat of war quite
at the end of the preceding year.</p>

<p>It is now that the ‘Letters’ enter into
the history of the lives of Marianna and
Noel Bouton de Chamilly. As is well
known, they were all written after the
latter’s retirement from Portugal, and
probably between the December of 1667
and the June of 1668, and they express
better than any remarks which we could
make the stages of faith, doubt, and
despair through which poor Marianna
passed. As a piece of unconscious,
though self-made, psychological analysis
they are unsurpassed; as a product of
the Peninsular heart they are unrivalled.
If they are not, as Theophilo Braga calls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
them, the only beautiful work produced
by his countrymen in the seventeenth
century, they are, at any rate, by far the
most beautiful. To compare them, as regards
literary form, with those of Heloïse
would be manifestly unfair, the situation
of the two women was so different.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
Think of the Abbess of the Paraclete,
mistress of all the learning of the time, and
surrounded by things to console her, or
at least to divert her attention, and then
regard poor Marianna, persecuted by her
family, and liable to the tender mercies
of the Inquisition, with none of the comforts,
none of the consolations of the
former. But if the ‘Letters’ of Heloise are
superior to those of Marianna from the
point of view of correctness of expression
and style, they are inferior in all else.
The nun’s are far more natural, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
therefore more beautiful, and the very
confusion of feelings and ideas which we
should expect from one in her position
rather adds to their charm. Finally,
the moral character of Heloïse as displayed
in her epistles cannot certainly,
be placed beside that of the Portuguese
nun with any advantage.</p>

<p>Henceforth, we only meet with the
name of Marianna at intervals&mdash;once in
1668, again in 1676 and 1709, and lastly
in an obituary notice in 1723.</p>

<p>She, at any rate, is not an example of
the well-known saying of Cervantes&mdash;‘the
Portuguese die of love.’ It is true
that some words at the end of the Fifth
Letter seem to suggest suicide, but there
is, on the other hand, throughout the
whole of these <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ultima verba</i> an expression
of energy and of her determination
to tread under foot, if she cannot
extinguish, the flames of her passion.
Marianna came of a vigorous race, and,
in spite of the great infirmities of which
her obituary speaks, she lived, as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
shall see, to the age of fourscore years
and three.</p>

<p>She was made Portress, as mentioned
in the Letters, at the beginning of 1668,
no doubt to distract her mind by giving
her some definite occupation and a sense
of responsibility. It is, however, significant,
as Cordeiro remarks, that we do
not find the name of Marianna, a
daughter of one of the principal and
most influential families in Beja, filling
any more elevated post, whereas her
younger sister Peregrina Maria appears
in the conventual register as both Amanuensis
and Abbess. This sister, before
professing in the same convent in 1676,
made her will, ‘being more than twelve
years of age,’ and there she spoke of
the many obligations which she owed
Marianna for having brought her up
‘from the age of three years.’<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Her entering
the Conception at such an early age
is explained by the fact of the death of
her mother, which took place at the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of 1663 or the beginning of 1664.
Again, in 1709, Marianna is mentioned
as beaten by only ten votes in an election
for the office of Abbess by a certain
nun of the name of Joanna de Bulhão,
of whom nothing is known.</p>

<p>The next time we hear of her is in
1723, the date of her death. The obituary
notice speaks for itself and for her
life, since the episode which the ‘Letters’
contain, and needs no comment. ‘On the
28th day of the month of July, in the year
1723, died, in this Royal Convent of Our
Lady of the Conception, Mother D.
Marianna Alcanforada,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> at the age of
eighty-seven years,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> all of which she
spent in the service of God. She was
always very regular in the choir and at
the confraternities, and withal fulfilled
her (other) obligations. She was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
exemplary, and none had fault to find
with her, for she was very kind to all.
For thirty years she did rigid penance
and suffered great infirmities with much
conformity, desiring to have more to
suffer. When she knew that her last
hour was come, she asked for all the
sacraments, which she received in a state
of perfect consciousness, giving many
thanks to God for having received them.
Thus she ended her life with all the
signs of predestination, speaking up to
the last hour, in proof of which I, D.
An<sup>ia</sup> Sophia Bap<sup>ta</sup> de Almeida, Amanuensis
of the Convent, wrote this, which I
signed on the same day, month and year
as above.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">D. An<sup>IA</sup> Sophia Bap<sup>TA</sup> de Alm<sup>DA</sup></span>,<br />
Amanuensis.’<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>No such obscurity as that which
hangs over the life of Marianna hides the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
doings of Chamilly after his return to
France. Acts like the famous defence
of Grave in 1674 against the Prince of
Orange, and that of Oudenarde two
years later, marked him out for future
distinction. But if he knew how to
defend towns he no less could attack
and take them. He distinguished himself
greatly at the sieges of Gand, Condé,
Yprés and Heidelberg, and in 1703
received the recompense of his great
services, being made a Marshal of France.</p>

<p>M. Asse tells several anecdotes about
him, which <em>seem</em> to show that he was a
generous man as well as a brave soldier.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
United in 1671 by a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mariage de convenance</i>
to a lady who, according to S.
Simon, was far from being gifted with
personal beauty, he was always a most
exemplary husband. S. Simon, who
knew him well, also tells us that Chamilly
was ‘the best man in the world, the
bravest, and the most honourable.’ He
says, too, that no one after seeing him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
or hearing him speak, could understand
how he had inspired such an unmeasured
love as that revealed in the famous
‘Letters.’<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>How, then, are we to reconcile the
Chamilly of the ‘Letters’ with the man
of whom his contemporaries and friends
speak so highly? The publication of the
Epistles of Marianna was doubtless due
to vanity, a fault which we may certainly
credit Chamilly with possessing. It was,
too, the custom in seventeenth-century
France to hand round copies of letters,
either received or written, for the admiration
of friends, and thus, what now
appears to us a brutal and cynical want
of confidence, was then the most natural
thing in the world.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> It is not, however,
so easy, even if it is possible, to excuse
the conduct of the French captain in the
betrayal and desertion of poor Marianna.
Posterity, as M. Asse says, especially the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
feminine portion, has condemned him,
and there seems to be no reason why
we should seek to reverse the verdict.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was in 1669 that the first edition
of what we know as the ‘Portuguese
Letters’ was published by Claude Barbin,
the well-known Parisian bookseller.
The translation seems to have been
made towards the middle of the year
preceding, and shortly after the return
of Chamilly to France. The Letters
were evidently shown by their possessor
as one of those trophies, or at least
souvenirs, which persons are accustomed
to bring back with them from a foreign
country.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The incognito, however, was
complete, and neither the name of their
recipient nor that of their translator was
inscribed on this <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">editio princeps</i>. That of
Marianna, indeed, the authoress, was
not known until early in this present
century, when in 1810 Boissonade discovered
her name written in a copy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the edition of 1669 by a contemporary
hand. The veracity of this note has
since been placed beyond doubt by the
recent researches of Senhor Cordeiro, who
has shown the persistence of a tradition
in Beja connecting the French captain
and the Portuguese nun.</p>

<p>The success of the first edition was
rapid and complete. A second by
Barbin, and two in foreign countries,
one in Amsterdam, the other in Cologne,
all in the same year, attest this. The
success, indeed, took such proportions,
that from the mutual rivalry of authors
and publishers there sprung up a new
kind of literature, that of ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les Portugaises</span>.’
The Five Letters of the nun
had followers like most successful
romances, and the title of ‘Portuguese
Letters’ became a generic name applying
not only to the imitations which
amplified subsequent editions, but also
to every kind of correspondence where
passion was shown <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">toute nue</i>.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>
<p>‘Brancas,’ says Mme. de Sévigné,
‘has written me a letter so excessively
tender as to make up for all his past
neglect. He speaks to me from his
heart in every line; if I were to reply
to him in the same tone, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ce seroit une
Portugaise</i>.’<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>In the same year, 1669, Barbin issued
a ‘second part’ of the Portuguese
Letters, which was counterfeited shortly
afterwards at Cologne, as the real ones
had been. This was written, we are
told in the preface, by a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">femme du monde</i>,
and its publication was suggested by
the favour with which the letters of the
nun had been received.</p>

<p>The publisher counted, as he said, on
the difference of style which distinguished
these fresh letters from the
original ones, to assure a success as
great as the first five had obtained.</p>

<p>After the second part came the so-called
‘Replies,’ all in the same year,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
and their publisher tells us in the preface
that ‘he is assured that the gentleman
who wrote them has returned to
Portugal.’ Shortly afterwards appeared
the ‘New Replies,’ but this time they
were given for what they were, ‘a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeu
d’esprit</i> for which the example of Aulus
Salinus writing replies to the Heroides
of Ovid, and, above all, the beauty of
the first Portuguese Letters, should serve
as an excuse.’<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>The motive, then, for the production
of the second part of the ‘Portuguese
Letters’ as for that of the ‘New Replies’
is satisfactorily explained, but how about
the ‘Replies’ themselves? Can we not
account for them by supposing that
it was felt necessary on the part of the
friends of Chamilly to attenuate the
sympathy expressed on all sides for the
unfortunate nun, and the censure which
must naturally have followed such a
base betrayal? Hence, proceeds Senhor
Cordeiro, the author of this suggestion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the publication of these Replies, whose
capital idea is to show us the seducer
of Marianna under a perfectly different
aspect and character from that which
readers of the Letters would naturally
attribute to him. However this may be,
it was not long before the name of their
hero came to be printed in editions of
the Letters, though, curiously enough,
it was first divulged in an edition
printed abroad&mdash;in Cologne&mdash;in 1669, a
copy of which is to be found in the
British Museum, marked 1085 <i>b.</i> 5 (2),
containing the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘The name of him to whom they (the
Letters) were written is the Chevalier de
Chamilly, and the name of him who
made the translation is Cuilleraque.’<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>More strange still, the French editions
of the Letters preserved a discreet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
silence as to the name of the recipient
with the exception of the 1671 edition
of the Replies, until the year 1690, when
a similar notice to that above referred to
as being in the Cologne edition was
made public; so that even in Chamilly’s
lifetime his name was appended to
editions of the Letters as their recipient,
and as far as we know he never denied
the authenticity of the ascription.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The question as to whether the Letters
were originally written in French,
or whether they are a translation, hardly
needs discussion here, for the principal
critics, both French and Portuguese&mdash;Dorat,
Malherbe, Filinto Elysio and
Sousa Botelho&mdash;have unanimously decided
from the text itself that they are
a translation, and a bad one. The last-named
says:&mdash;‘A Portuguese, or indeed
any one knowing that language, cannot
doubt but that the Five Letters of the
Nun have been translated almost literally
from a Portuguese original. The con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>struction
of many of the phrases is such
that, if re-translated word for word, they
are found to be entirely in harmony
with the genius and character of that
language.’<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>But it is just this baldness for which
we should all be truly thankful, because
we are thus enabled to listen to what
Marianna said, and hear how she said it.
Had the translation been what the seventeenth
century would have called a good
one, we should have known M. Guilleragues
well enough, it is true, but only seen
the nun ‘darkly as through a glass.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As to the present version, the author
can only add to what he has already
said in the Preface, by confessing that
he feels its inadequacy as much as any
of his critics will doubtless do. At the
same time, however, if its result be to
excite competition, and call forth a better
one, his labour will not, he thinks, have
been in vain.</p>

which is like nothing else but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
cruelty of the absence which occasions
it. What! must this absence,
to which my sorrow, all ingenious
though it be, cannot give a sad
enough name, deprive me for ever
of a sight of those eyes in which I
was wont to see so much love,
which made me feel so full of joy,
which took the place of all else to
me, and which, in a word, were all
that I desired? Mine eyes, alas!
have lost the only light that gave
them life, tears alone are left them,
and ceaseless weeping is the sole
employment I have given them since
I learned that you were bent upon
a separation so unbearable to me
that it must soon bring about my
death. But yet it seems to me that I
cling in some sort to the sorrows of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
which you are the sole cause. I
consecrated my life to you from the
moment when I first saw you, and
I feel a certain pleasure in sacrificing
it to you. I send you my
sighs a thousand times each day,
they seek you everywhere, and as
sole recompense of so much disquietude
they bring me back a
warning too true, alas, of my unhappiness:
an unhappiness which
is cruel enough to prevent me from
flattering myself with hope, and
which is ever calling to me&mdash;Cease,
cease to wear thyself out in vain, ill-fated
Marianna, cease looking for a
lover whom thou wilt never see
again, who has crossed the seas to
fly from thee, who is now in France
in the midst of pleasures, who is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
thinking for one moment on thy
sorrows, who would not thank thee
for these pangs for which he feels
no gratitude. But no, I cannot
make up my mind to think so ill
of you, and I am too much concerned
that you should right yourself.
I do not even wish to think
that you have forgotten me. Am
I not unhappy enough already
without torturing myself with
false suspicions? And why should
I try so hard to forget all the care
you took to prove your love for
me? I was so enchanted with it
all that I should be ungrateful
indeed were I not still to love you
with the same transports that my
passion lent me when I enjoyed
the pledges of your love. How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
can the memory of moments so
sweet have become so bitter? And,
contrary to their nature, must they
serve only to tyrannise over my
heart? Alas, poor heart! your
last letter brought it into a strange
state; it endured such strong pangs
that it seemed to be trying to tear
itself from me to go and seek for
you. I was so overcome by all
these violent emotions that I was
beside myself for more than three
hours.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> It was as though I refused
to come back to a life which I feel
bound to lose for you since I cannot
preserve it for you. In spite
of myself, however, I became myself
again; I flattered myself with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the feeling that I was dying of love,
and besides, I was well pleased at
the thought of being no longer
obliged to see my heart torn by
grief at your absence. Ever since
those first symptoms I have suffered
much from ill-health, but can I ever
be well again until I see you?
And yet I am bearing it without a
murmur since it comes from you.
What! is this the reward you give
me for loving you so tenderly?
But it matters not; I am resolved
to adore you all my life and to care
for no one else, and I tell you that
you too will do well to love no
other. Could you ever content
yourself with a love colder than
mine? You will perhaps find
more beauty elsewhere (yet you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
told me once that I was very
beautiful), but you will never find
so much love: and all the rest is
nothing. Do not fill any more of
your letters with trifles: and do
not write and tell me again to
remember you. I cannot forget
you, and as little do I forget the
hope you gave me that you would
come and spend some time with
me. Alas! why are you not willing
to pass your whole life at my
side? Could I leave this unhappy
cloister I should not await in
Portugal the fulfilment of your
promises. I should go fearlessly
over the whole world seeking you,
following you, and loving you. I
dare not flatter myself that this can
be. I do not care to feed a hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
that would certainly give me some
pleasure, while I wish to feel nothing
but sorrow. Yet I confess the
chance of writing to you which my
brother gave me suddenly aroused
in me a certain feeling of joy, and
checked for a time the despair in
which I live. I conjure you to tell
me why you set yourself to bewitch
me as you did, when you well
knew that you would have to forsake
me. Why were you so bent
on making me unhappy? Why
did you not leave me at peace in
my cloister? Had I done you any
wrong? But I ask your pardon.
I am not accusing you. I am not
in a state to think on vengeance,
and I only blame the harshness of
my fate. It seems to me that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
separating us it has done us all the
harm that we could fear from it.
It will not succeed in separating
our hearts,&mdash;for love, more powerful
than it, has united them for ever.
If you take any interest in my lot
write to me often. I well deserve
your taking some pains to let me
know the state of your heart and
fortune. Above all, come and see
me. Good-bye. I cannot make
up my mind to part from this letter.
It will fall into your hands: would
I might have the same happiness!
Ah, how foolish I am! I know so
well that this is impossible. Good-bye.
I can no more. Good-bye.
Love me always and make me
suffer still more.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">YOUR</span> lieutenant has
just told me that a
storm has forced you
to put into port in
the Algarve.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> I am
afraid you have
suffered much on the sea, and so
much has this fear absorbed me that
I have thought no more on all my
troubles. Do you think, perchance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
that your lieutenant takes more
interest in what happens to you than
I do? If not, why then is he better
informed of it? And then, why
have you not written to me? I am
unlucky indeed if you have found
no time for writing since you left,
and still more so if you could have
written and would not. Your
injustice and ingratitude are too
great; but I should be in despair
if they were to cause you any harm.
I had rather you should remain
unpunished than that they should
avenge me. I withstand all the
appearances which ought to persuade me
that you do not love me at all, and
I feel much more disposed to yield
myself blindly to my passion than
to the reasons you give me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
complain of your neglect. What
mortification you would have spared
me, if, in the days when I first saw
you, your conduct had been as cold
as it has seemed to me for some
time now! But who would not
have been deceived by such ardour
as you then showed, and who would
not have thought it sincere? How
hard it is to make up one’s mind to
doubt for any time the sincerity
of those one loves! I see clearly
that the least excuse is good enough
for you; and, without your troubling
to make it to me, my love for
you serves you so faithfully that I
cannot consent to find you guilty,
except for the sake of enjoying the
infinite pleasure of declaring you
guiltless myself. You overcame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
me by your assiduities, you kindled
my passions with your transports,
your tenderness fascinated me, your
vows persuaded me, but it was the
violence of my own love which led
me away; and this beginning at
once so sweet and so happy, has left
nothing behind it but tears, sighs,
and a wretched death, without the
possibility of my ministering any
relief to myself. It is true that in
loving you I enjoyed a pleasure
unthought of before, but this very
pleasure is now costing me a sorrow,
which once I knew nothing of. All
the emotions which you cause me
run to extremes. If I had shown
obstinacy in resisting your love, if I
had given you any motive for anger
or jealousy in order to draw you on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the more, if you had detected any
artifice in my conduct, if, in a word,
I had wished to oppose my reason
to the natural inclination I felt for
you, and which you soon made
me perceive (though doubtless my
efforts would have been useless),
you might then have punished me
severely and used your power over
me with some show of justice. But
you seemed to me worthy of my
love before you had told me that
you loved me: you gave evidence
of a great passion for me: I was
overjoyed at it, and I gave myself
up to love you to distraction. You
were not blinded as I was. Why
then did you let me fall into the
state in which I now am? What
did you want with all my raptures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
which must have been very troublesome
to you? You well knew that
you would not stay in Portugal for
ever. Then why did you single
me out to make me so unhappy?
Doubtless you might, in this country,
have found some woman more
beautiful than I am, one with whom
you could have enjoyed as much
pleasure,&mdash;since in this you only
sought the grosser kind&mdash;one who
would have loved you faithfully as
long as you were with her, whom
time would have consoled for your
absence, and whom you might have
left without either treachery or
cruelty. You act more like a
tyrant bent on persecution than a
lover whose only thought should
be how to please. Alas! why do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
you treat so harshly a heart which
is yours? I can see very well that
you let yourself be turned against
me as easily as I let myself be convinced
in your favour. Without
needing to call on all my love, and
without imagining that I had done
anything out of the way, I should
have resisted much stronger arguments
than those can be which
have moved you to leave me.
They would have seemed to me
very weak, and none could have
been strong enough to tear me from
your side. But you were ready to
make use of the first pretexts that
you found in order to get back to
France. A vessel was sailing.
Why did you not let it sail? Your
family had written to you. Surely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
you know all the persecutions which
I have suffered from mine? Your
honour obliged you to abandon me.
Did I take any care of mine? You
were forced to go and serve your
king. If all they say of him is true
he has no need of your help, and
would have excused you. I should
have been only too happy if we
could have passed our whole lives
together, but since it was fated that
a cruel absence should separate us,
I think I ought to be glad indeed
at the thought of not having been
faithless, and I would not wish to
have committed such a base act for
anything in the world. What! you
who have known the depths of my
heart and affection, could you make
up your mind to leave me for ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
and expose me to the dread of feeling
that you only remember me in order
to sacrifice me to some new passion?</p>

<p>I well know that I love you as
one distracted. Withal I do not
complain of all the violence of my
heart’s emotions; I am accustoming
myself to its tortures, and I could
not live without the pleasure which
I find and enjoy in loving you in the
midst of a thousand sorrows. But
a disgust and hatred for everything
torments me constantly; I feel my
family, my friends, and this convent
unbearable. All I am forced to see
and everything I am obliged to do
is hateful to me. I have grown so
jealous of my passion that methinks
all my actions and all my duties
have regard to you. Yes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
I have scruples in not employing
every moment of my life for you.
Ah! what should I do without the
extremities of hate and love which
fill my heart? Could I survive that
which incessantly fills my thoughts,
and lead a quiet cold life? Such a
void, and such a lack of feeling,
could never suit me. All have noticed
how completely I am changed
in my humour, my manners, and my
person. My mother<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> spoke to me
about it, sharply at first, but afterwards
more kindly. I know not
what I said in reply. I think I
confessed all to her. Even the
strictest religious pity my condition,
and are moved by a certain consideration
and regard for me. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
one, in fact, is touched by my love:
and you alone remain profoundly
indifferent. You write me letters
at once cold and full of repetitions;
the paper is not half filled, and you
make it quite clear that you are
dying to finish them.</p>

<p>Dona Brites has been importuning
me for several days to get me to
leave my room, and thinking to
divert me she took me for a walk
upon the balcony, from which one
sees the gates of Mertola.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> I went
with her, but at once cruel memories
assailed me, and these made me weep
for the rest of the day. She brought
me back to my room, and there I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
threw myself on the bed and thought
a thousand times on the little hope
I have of ever being well again.
What is done to alleviate only embitters
my grief, and I find in the
very remedies themselves particular
reasons for fresh sorrows. It
was from that spot that I often saw
you pass by with that air which
charmed me so, and I was up on
that balcony on the fatal day when
I began to feel the first effects of
my unhappy passion. Methought
you were wishing to please me,
although as yet you did not know
me. I persuaded myself that you
singled me out among all my
companions. When you paused I
thought you were pleased for me to
see you better and admire your skill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and grace whilst you caracoled your
horse. A sudden fright came over
me when you made it go over some
difficult place. In a word, I interested
myself secretly in every act
of yours. I felt quite sure you were
not indifferent to me, and I took as
meant for me all that you did. You
know too well what came of all this;
and although I have nothing to hide,
I ought not to write to you so
much about it, lest I make you
more guilty than you are already,
if that be possible, and lest I have
to reproach myself with so many
useless efforts to oblige you to be
faithful. This you will never be.
Can I ever hope that my letters
and reproaches will have an effect
on your ingratitude that my love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
for you and your desertion of me
have not had? I know my sad
fate too well: your injustice leaves
me not the slightest reason to doubt
of it, and I am bound to fear the
worst, since you have cast me off.
Have you a charm only for me, and
do not other eyes find you pleasing?
I should not be annoyed, I think,
were the feelings of others in some
sort to justify mine, and I would
wish all the women in France to
find you agreeable, but none to love
you, none please you. This idea
is ridiculous and impossible I well
know. I have already, however,
found by experience that you are
incapable of a great affection, and
that you could easily forget me
without any help, and without a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
fresh love obliging you to it. I
would, perhaps, wish you to have
some reasonable pretext for your
desertion of me. It is true that I
should then be more unhappy, but
you would not be so guilty. You
mean to stay in France, I perceive,
without great enjoyments, may be,
but in the possession of full liberty.
The fatigue of a long voyage, some
punctilios of good manners, and the
fear of not being able to correspond
to my ardent passion, keep you
there. Oh do not be afraid of
me; I will be content with seeing
you from time to time, and knowing
only that we are in the same
country; but perhaps I flatter myself,
and may be you will be more
touched by the rigour and hardness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
of another woman than you have
been by all my favours. Can it be
that cruelty will inflame you more?</p>

<p>But before engaging yourself in
any great passion, think well on the
excess of my sorrows, on the uncertainty
of my purposes, on the contradictions
in my emotions, on the
extravagance of my letters, on my
trustfulness, my despair, my desires,
and my jealousy. Oh! you are on
the way to make yourself unhappy.
I conjure you to profit by my example,
that at least what I am suffering
for you may not be useless
to you. Five or six months ago
you told me a secret which troubled
me, and acknowledged, only too
frankly, that you had once loved
a lady in your own country. If it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
is she who prevents you from returning
here, do not scruple to tell
me, that I may fret no more. I am
borne up by some remnants of hope
still, but I should be well pleased, if
it can have no good result, to lose
it at a blow, and myself with it.
Send me her likeness and some one of
her letters, and write me all she
says. Perchance I shall find reasons
wherewith to console myself, or it
may be to afflict myself still more.
I cannot remain any longer in my
present state, and any change whatsoever
must be to my advantage.
I should also like to have the portrait
of your brother and of your
sister-in-law.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> All that concerns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
you is very dear to me, and I am
wholly given up to what touches
you in any way: I have no inclination
of my own left. Sometimes,
methinks, I could even submit to
wait upon her whom you love.
Your bad treatment and disdain
have broken me down so far that
at times I do not dare to think I
could be jealous and yet not displease
you, and I go so far as to
think that I should be doing the
greatest wrong in the world were I
to upbraid you. I am often convinced
that I ought not to let you
see, so madly as I do, feelings
which you disown. An officer has
now been waiting long for this
letter. I had resolved to write it
in such a way that you might re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>ceive
it without annoyance, but as
it is, it is too extravagant, and I
must close it. Alas! I cannot bring
myself to this. I seem to be speaking
to you whilst I write, and you
seem to be more present to me.
The next<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> letter shall neither be so
long nor so troublesome; you may
open and read it assured of this. It
is true that I ought not to speak of
a passion which displeases you, and
I will not speak of it again. In a
few days it will be a year since I
gave myself up to you without reserve.
Your love seemed to me
very warm and sincere, and I should
never have thought that my favours
would so annoy you as to oblige<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
you to voyage five hundred leagues
and expose yourself to the risk of
shipwreck to escape from them. I
have not deserved such treatment
as this at any man’s hands. You
may remember my modesty, my
shame, and my confusion, but you
do not remember what would
make you love me in spite of
yourself. The officer who is to
carry you this letter sends to me
for the fourth time to say that
he wishes to be gone. How pressing
he is! doubtless he is leaving
some unhappy lady in this
country.</p>

<p>Good-bye. It costs me more to
finish this letter than it cost you to
quit me, perhaps for ever. Good-bye.
I do not dare give you a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
thousand names of love, nor abandon
myself to all my feelings without
restraint. I love you a thousand
times more than my life, and a
thousand times more than I think
for. How dear you are to me, and
yet how cruel! You do not write
to me. I could not help saying
this to you again. But I am beginning
afresh, and the officer will
be gone. What matters it? Let
him go. ’Tis not so much for your
sake that I write as for my own.
I only seek some solace. Besides,
the very length of my letter will
frighten you, and you will not read
it. What have I done to be so
unhappy? And why have you
poisoned my life? Why was I not
born in some other country? Good-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>bye,
and forgive me. I dare not
now pray you to love me. See to
what my fate has brought me.
Good-bye!</p>

<p>... Que este pequeno penhor de meus longos

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">WHAT</span> will become of
me, and what would
you have me do?
How far I am now
from all that I had
looked forward to!
I hoped that you would write
me from every place you passed
through, and that your letters
would be very long ones,&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
you would feed my love by the
hope of seeing you again, that
full trust in your fidelity would
give me some sort of rest, and that
I should then remain in a state
bearable enough, and without the
extremes of sorrow. I had even
thought of some poor plans of
endeavouring, as far as possible,
my own cure, in case I could but
once assure myself that you had
entirely forgotten me. The distance
which you are at, certain
impulses of devotion, the fear of
entirely destroying the remainder
of my health by so many wakeful
nights and so many cares, the
improbability of your return, the
coldness of your love, and your last
good-byes,
your departure based on such cruel pretexts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>,
and a thousand other
reasons which are only too good
and too useless, seemed to offer me
a safe refuge if I needed one.
Having indeed only myself to
reckon with,
I could never have been on my
guard against all my weaknesses,
nor foresee
all that I now suffer. Ah! how
pitiful it is for me,&mdash;I that am not
able to share with you my sorrows,
and must be all alone in my grief!
This thought is killing me, and I
almost die of horror when I think
that you were never really affected
by all the bliss that we shared.
Yes, I understand now the untruth
of all your transports. You betrayed
me every time you told
me that your supreme delight was
to be alone with me. It is to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
importunities alone that I owe your
warmth and passion. Deliberately
and in cold blood you formed a
design to kindle my love; you
only regarded my passion as your
triumph, and your heart was never
deeply touched. Are you not very
wretched? and have you so little
delicacy that you made no other
use of my love but this?</p>

<p>How then can it be that with
such love I have not been able to
make you entirely happy? It is
solely for love of you that I regret
the infinite pleasures you have lost.
Can it be that you did not care to enjoy them?
Ah! if you only knew them you
would doubtless find them much
greater than that of having deceived
me, and you would have experienced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
how much happier it is, and how
much more poignant it is to love
violently than to be loved. I know
not what I am, or what I do, or
what I wish for. I am torn asunder
by a thousand contrary emotions.
Can a more deplorable state be
imagined? I love you to distraction,
and therefore I spare you
sufficiently not to dare to wish that
the same emotions should trouble
you. I should kill myself or die of
grief without were I to be assured
that you were never having any
rest, that your life was as anxious
and disturbed as mine, that you
were weeping ceaselessly, and that
everything was hateful to you. I
cannot bear my own sufferings,
how then could I support the sor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>row
a thousand times more grievous
which yours would give me? I
cannot, on the other hand, make up
my mind to wish that you should
think no more of me; and to speak
frankly, I am furiously jealous of
all that gives you pleasure, and
comes near to your heart and fancy
in France. I know not why I write
to you. I perceive that you will
only pity me, and I wish for none
of your pity. I hate myself when
I look back on all that I have
sacrificed for you. I have lost my
honour. I have exposed myself to
the anger of my parents, to all the
severity of the laws of this country
against religious, and finally to your
ingratitude, which has seemed to
me the greatest of all my evils.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Withal, I feel that my remorse is
not real, and that I would willingly,
with all my heart, have run the
greatest risks for the love of you,
and that I experience a sad pleasure
in having risked my life and honour
in your service. Ought not all that
I hold most dear to be at your
disposal? Ought I not to be
satisfied at having employed it
as I have done?
Methinks, even, I am not at all content
with my sorrows,
or the excess of my love, although
I cannot, alas! flatter myself sufficiently
to be content with you. I
live, unfaithful that I am; I do as
much to preserve my life as to lose
it. Ah! I am dying of shame. Is
my despair then only in my letters?
If I loved you, as I have told you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
a thousand times, should I not have
been dead long ago? I have deceived
you, and you may rightly
complain of me. Alas! why do
you not complain of me? I saw
you leave, I can never hope to
see you come back, and in spite of
all I yet breathe! I have deluded
you. I ask your pardon, but do
not grant it me. Treat me harshly&mdash;say
my love for you is too weak;
be more hard to please; tell me
that you would have me die of love
for your sake. Help me thus, I
conjure you, to overcome the weakness
of my sex, and to put an end
to all my wavering in real despair.
Doubtless a tragic end would force
you to think of me often, my
memory would become dear to you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and perhaps you would be really
touched by so uncommon a death.
Would not death be better than
the state to which you have brought
me? Good-bye. How I wish that
I had never seen you. Ah! I feel
how false this phrase is, and I
know at the very moment in which
I write it that I had far rather be
unhappy in my love for you than
never have seen you. Willingly,
and without a murmur, I consent
to my evil fate, since it has not
been your wish to make it happier.
Good-bye; promise me a few tender
regrets if I die of grief, or at
least that you will let the violence
of my love give you a disgust and
repulsion for everything else. This
consolation will suffice me, and if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
I must leave you for ever, I would
wish not to leave you to another
woman.
Would it not be very cruel indeed of you to make
use of my
despair to render yourself more
agreeable, and to let it be seen
that you have inspired the greatest
passion in the world? Good-bye
once again. My letters are too
long, and I do not regard you
sufficiently. I ask your pardon,
and dare hope that you will show
some indulgence to a poor mad
woman who was not so, as you
know, before she loved you. Good-bye.
Methinks I too often speak
to you of the insufferable state in
which I am, yet I thank you from
the bottom of my heart for the
despair which you cause me, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
I hate the peace which I lived in
before I knew you.</p>

<p>Good-bye! My love grows
stronger each moment. Oh what
a world of things I have to tell
you of!</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">METHINKS</span> I do the
greatest possible
wrong to the feelings
of my heart
in trying to make
them known to
you in writing. How happy
should I be could you judge of
my passion by the violence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
yours! But I must not compare
my feelings with yours, though I
cannot help telling you, much less
strongly than I feel it, it is true, that
you ought not to maltreat me as
you do by a forgetfulness which
thrusts me into despair, and which
even for you is dishonourable. It
is but fair that you should allow me
to complain of the evils which I
clearly foresaw when I perceived
that you were resolved to forsake
me. I well know now that I deluded
myself, thinking as I did that you
would deal with me in better faith
than is usually the case, because
the excess of my love put me, it
seemed, above all kind of suspicion,
and merited more fidelity than is
ordinarily met with. But your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
wish to deceive me overruled the
justice you owe me for all that
I have done for you. I should
still be unhappy even if you only
loved me because I love you, and
I would wish to owe it all to your
inclination alone. But so far is
this from being the case that I
have not received a single letter
from you for the last six months.
I put down all my misfortunes to
the blindness with which I gave
myself up to love of you. Should
I not have foreseen that the end of
my pleasure would come before
that of my love? Could I expect
you to stay all your life in Portugal
and give up both country and
career and think only of me?
Nothing can lighten my sorrow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and the remembrance of all that
I enjoyed fills me with despair.
What! is all my desire then to be in vain?
and shall I never see
you again in my room with all the
ardour and passion which you once
showed? But, alas! I am deceiving
myself, and I know too well that
all the feelings that filled my head
and heart were only excited in you
by a few pleasures, and that they
both ended at the same time. I
ought then in those moments of
supreme happiness to have called
reason to my aid to moderate the
deadly excess of my delight, and to
foretell to me all that I am now
suffering. But I gave myself up to
you entirely, and I was not in a
state to think of anything which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
would have poisoned my pleasure
and prevented me from fully enjoying
the pledges of your ardent love.
I was too much delighted to feel
that I was with you to think that
you would one day be far from me.
I remember, however, having told
you sometimes that you would
make me unhappy, but these fears
were soon dissipated, and I took
pleasure in sacrificing them to you,
and in giving myself up to the
enchantment and the faithlessness
of your protests. I see clearly the
remedy for all the evils which I
suffer, and I should be soon rid of
them if I loved you no more. But
alas! what a remedy! I had rather
suffer still more than forget you.
Does that, alas! depend on me? I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
cannot reproach myself with having
for a single moment wished to cease
to love you. You are more to be
pitied than I am, and all my sufferings
are better than the cold
pleasures which your French mistresses
give you. I do not envy
you your indifference, and you
make me pity you. I defy you to
forget me entirely. I flatter myself
that I have put you in a state in
which you can enjoy but imperfect
pleasures without me, and I am
happier than you because I am
more occupied. Some little time
ago I was made portress of this
convent. All who speak to me
think that I am mad. I know not
what I answer them. The religious
must be as mad as myself to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
thought me capable of taking care
of anything. Oh how I envy the
good fortune of Manoel and Francisco!<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
Why am I not always with
you, as they are? I would have
followed you and waited upon you
with more goodwill, it is certain.
To see you is all that I desire in
this world. At least remember me;
for you to remember me will content
me, but I dare not make sure
even of this. I used not to limit
my hopes to your remembrance of
me when I saw you daily, but you
have taught me the necessity of
submitting to all that you wish.
Withal I do not repent of having
adored you; I am glad that you
betrayed me, and your absence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
cruel though it is, and perhaps
eternal, diminishes in no way the
violence of my love. I wish everybody
to know it; I make no mystery
of it; and I pride myself on
having done for you all that I did
against every kind of decorum.
My honour and religion consist but
in loving you to distraction all my
life through, since I have begun to
love you. I am not telling you all
this to oblige you to write to me.
Oh do not force yourself; I only
wish from you what comes spontaneously,
and I reject all the testimonies
of your love which you can
control. I shall find pleasure in excusing
you, because you will perhaps
be glad not to have the trouble of
writing to me, and I feel deeply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
disposed to pardon you all your
faults. A French officer had the
charity to talk to me of you for
three hours this morning; he told
me that peace was made with
France.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> If this is so could you
not come and see me, and take me
to France? But I do not deserve
it. Do as you please, for my love
no longer depends on the way in
which you may treat me. I have
not been well for a single moment
since you left, and my only pleasure
has been that of repeating your
name a thousand times each day.
Some religious who know the deplorable
state into which you have
plunged me often speak to me of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
you. I leave my room, where you
so often used to come to see me, as
little as possible, and I constantly
look at your likeness, which is to
me a thousand times clearer than
life itself. It gives me some
pleasure, but also much sorrow,
when I consider that I shall perchance
never see you again.</p>

<p>Why must it be that I shall
possibly never see you again?
Have you then left me for ever?
I am in despair. Your poor
Marianna can no more; she is
almost fainting while she finishes
this letter. Good-bye, Good-bye.
Have pity on me.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">I AM</span> writing to you
for the last time,
and I hope to let
you see by the difference
in the terms
and manner of this
letter that you have at last persuaded
me that you no longer love me, and
that therefore I ought no longer to
love you. I will send you on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
first opportunity all that I still have
of yours. Do not be afraid that I
shall write to you; I will not even
put your name on the packet. With
all these details I have charged
Dona Brites,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> whom I have accustomed
to confidences very different
from this. Her care will be less
suspected than mine. She will take
all the necessary precautions, that
I may be assured that you have
received the portrait and bracelets
which you gave me. I wish you
to know, however, that for some
days I have felt as if I could burn
and tear up these tokens of your
love, once so dear to me. But
I have revealed such weakness to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
your eyes that you would perhaps
never have believed me capable
of going to a like extremity. I
wish, however, to enjoy all the
pain I have experienced in separating
from them, and cause you
some vexation at least. I confess,
to your shame and mine, that I
found myself more attached to
these trifles than I should like to
tell you, and I felt that I had again
need of all my reasoning powers to
enable me to get rid of each object
in spite of my flattering myself that
I cared no more for you. But,
provided with such good reasons as
mine, one always achieves the end
one seeks. I have placed them in
the hands of Dona Brites. What
tears this resolution cost me! After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
a thousand different emotions and
doubts which you know not of, and
of which I shall certainly not give
you an account, I have conjured
her to speak no more to me of these
baubles, and never to give them
back to me even though I should
beg to see them once again, and, in
a word, to send them you without
letting me know.</p>

<p>It is only since I have been employing
all my efforts to heal myself
that I have come to know the excess
of my love, and I fear that I
should not have dared to take it in
hand had I foreseen so many difficulties
and such violence. I am
persuaded that I should have experienced
less disagreeable emotions
in loving you, ungrateful though you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
are, than in quitting you for ever.
I have found out that you were
less dear to me than my passion;
and I have had hard work to fight
against it even after your insulting
behaviour made you hateful to me.
The pride natural to my sex has
not helped me to resolve aught
against you. Alas! I suffered your
scorn, and I could have supported
your hate and all the jealousy which
the attachment you might have had for
another woman could have caused me.
I should have had
at least some passion to combat, but
your indifference is insupportable to
me. Your impertinent protestations
of friendship, and the ridiculous
civilities of your last letter,
convince me that you have received
all those which I have written to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
you, that they have stirred no
emotions in your heart, and yet that
you have read them. O ungrateful
man! I am still foolish enough
to be in despair at not being able to
flatter myself that they have not
reached you or been given into
your hands. I detest your frankness.
Did I ever ask you to tell
me the truth sincerely? Why did
you not leave me my love? You
had only not to write; I did not
seek to be enlightened. Am I not
unhappy enough with all my inability
to make the task of deceiving
me difficult to you, and now at not
being able to exculpate you. Know
that I am convinced that you are
unworthy of all my love, and that I
understand all your base qualities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
If, however, all that I have done
for you deserves that you should
pay some slight regard to the favours
I ask of you, write no more to me,
I beg you, and help me to forget
you entirely. If you were to show,
even slightly, that you had felt some
grief at the reading of this letter,
perchance I should believe you.
Perchance, also, your acknowledgment
and assent would vex and
anger me, and all that would inflame
my love afresh. Do not then take
any account of my life, or you would
doubtless overthrow all my plans,
however you entered into them. I
care not to know the result of this
letter, and I beg of you not to
disturb the peace which I am preparing
for myself. Methinks you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
may content yourself with the harm
which you have already caused
me, whatever be the intention you
formed to make me miserable. Do
not tear me from my state of uncertainty;
I hope in time to combine
with it something like peace of
heart. I promise not to hate you;
indeed I distrust any violent feelings
too much to adventure that.
I am persuaded that I should find,
it may be in this country, another
lover more faithful and handsomer;
but, alas! who could make me feel
love? Would a passion for another
man fill my thoughts? Has mine
had any power over you? Have I
not experienced that a tender heart
never forgets what first awakened it to feelings
it knew not that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
was capable of? I have found that
all the feelings of such a heart are
bound up with the idol it has created
for itself&mdash;that its first impressions,
its first wounds, can neither be
healed nor effaced&mdash;that all the
passions which offer their help and
attempt to fill and content it promise
it but vainly an emotion which
it never feels again&mdash;that all the
pleasures which it seeks, without
any desire of finding them, serve
only to convince it that nothing is
so dear as the remembrance of its
sorrows? Why have you made me
feel the imperfection and bitterness
of an attachment which cannot endure
for ever, and all the evils that
result from a violent love, when it is
not mutual? Why is it that blind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
inclination and cruel fate agree as a
rule in determining us in favour of
those who could only love others?
Even if I could hope for some
diversion in a new engagement,
and could find a man of good faith,
I pity myself so much that I should
have great scruples in putting the
worst man in the world in the condition
to which you have brought me;
and although I may not be obliged
to spare you I could not make up
my mind to avenge myself so cruelly,
even though it were to depend on
me, by a change which I certainly
do not foresee. At this very moment
I am seeking excuses for you, and
I understand that a religious is not
as a rule loveable. Methinks, however,
if reason guided one’s choice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
one ought to be more attached to
them than to other women. Nothing
prevents their thinking constantly
of their passion, and they are not
turned aside by a thousand things
which divert and occupy the mind
in the world. Surely it cannot be
very pleasing to see those whom
one loves ever distracted by a
thousand trifles, and one must needs
have but little delicacy to suffer
them (without being in despair at
it) to talk of nothing but assemblies,
dress, and promenades. One is constantly
exposed to fresh jealousies,
for they are tied down to attentions,
politenesses, and conversations with
all. Who can be assured that they
find no pleasure in all these occasions,
and that they always endure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
their husbands with extreme disgust
and never of their freewill? Ah,
how they ought to distrust a lover
who does not make them render an exact
account of all, who believes easily
and without disquiet what they tell
him, who in unruffled trust sees
them bound to all these society
duties. But I do not seek to prove
to you by good reasons that you
ought to love me; these are very
ill means, and I have made use of
much better, without success. Too
well do I know my fate to try to
rise above it. I shall be miserable
all my life. Was I not so even
when I saw you daily? I was
dying for fear that you would not
be faithful. I wished to see you
every moment, and I could not.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
The danger you ran in entering the
convent troubled me. I almost died
when you were with the army. I
was in despair at not being more
beautiful and more worthy of you.
I used to murmur against my modest
rank,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and I often thought that the
attachment you appeared to cherish
for me would be hurtful to you in
some way. Methought I did not
love you enough. I feared the
anger of my parents against you,
and I was, in a word, in as lamentable
a state then as now. If you
had shown me any signs of affection
since you left Portugal I should
have made every effort to leave it,
and I would have disguised myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
to go and find you. Ah, what
would have became of me if you
had troubled no more about me
after I had arrived in France?&mdash;what
confusion, what a false step, what depths
of shame for my family which
is so dear to me since I have ceased
to love you! I quite understand,
you see, that I might have been
even more wretched than I am. At
least for once in my life I am
speaking reasonably to you. How
delighted you will doubtless be at
my moderation, and how pleased
with me? But I wish not to know
it. I have already prayed you not
to write to me again, and I repeat
it now. Have you never reflected
on the way in which you have
treated me? Have you never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
considered that you owe me more
than any one else in the world? I
have loved you as a mad woman
might. How I despised everything
else!</p>

<p>Besides, you have not acted like
an honourable man. You must
have had a natural aversion for me,
since you have not loved me to
distraction. I allowed myself to
be enchanted by very mediocre
qualities. What have you ever
done to please me? What sacrifice
have you made for me? Did you
not always seek a thousand other
pleasures? Did you ever give up
gaming or the chase? Were you
not ever the first to leave for the
army, and did you not always come
back the last? You exposed your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>self
rashly, although I had begged
you to spare yourself for my sake.
You never sought the means of
settling down in Portugal, where
you were esteemed. A single letter
from your brother made you leave
without a moment’s hesitation. Do
I not know that during the voyage
you were in the best of humours?
It must be confessed that I ought
to hate you with a deadly hatred.
Ah, I have brought down all these
misfortunes on myself. I accustomed
you from the first to a
boundless love, and that with too
much ingenuousness, while one needs
to employ artifice to make one’s self
loved. One should seek the means
of skilfully exciting it, for love of
itself does not engender love. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
wished me to love you, and since
you had formed this design there is
nothing that you would not have
done to accomplish it. You would
even have made up your mind to
love me had that been necessary,
but you knew that you could succeed
in your enterprise without passion,
and that you had no need of it.
What treachery! did you think
that you could deceive me with
impunity? If any chance brings
you again to this country, I declare
that I will hand you over to the
vengeance of my kinsfolk. I have
lived too long, in an abandonment
and idolatry which strikes me
with horror, and feelings of remorse
persecute me with unbearable
severity. I feel a lively shame for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the crimes which you have made
me commit, and I have no more,
alas! the love which prevented me
from comprehending their enormity.
When will this heart of mine cease
to be torn? When shall I be freed
from these cruel trammels?</p>

<p>In spite of all, methinks I do not
wish you harm, and could resolve to
consent to your being happy. But
how could you be so, if you had a
true heart? I mean to write you
another letter, to show you that I
shall perchance be more at peace
some day. What pleasure I shall
find in being able to reproach you
for your injustice when I am no
longer so vividly touched by it, in
letting you know that I despise
you, and that I can speak with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
indifference of your deceit, that I
have forgotten all my pleasures and
all my sorrows, and that I only
remember you when I wish to do
so! I recognise that you have a
great advantage over me, and that
you have inspired in me a love
which has upset my reason; but at
the same time you should take little
credit to yourself for it. I was
young, I was trustful, I had been
shut up in this convent since my
childhood,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> I had only seen people
whom I did not care for. I had
never heard the praises which you
constantly gave me. Methought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
I owed you the charms and the
beauty which you found in me, and
which you were the first to make
me perceive: I heard you well
talked of; every one spoke in your
favour: you did all that was necessary
to awake love in me. But I
have at last returned to myself from
this enchantment. You yourself
helped me greatly, and I confess
that I had much need of it. When
I return you your letters I shall
take care to keep the last two
which you wrote me; and I shall
re-read them more often than I
have the previous ones, in order
that I may not relapse into my
former weakness. Ah! how dear
they cost me, and how happy I
should have been if you had allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
me to love you always. I well
know that I am still a little too
much taken up with my reproaches
and your faithlessness, but remember
that I have promised myself a state
of greater peace, and that I shall
reach it, or take some desperate
resolve against myself, which you
will learn, without great displeasure.
But I wish no more of you, and I
am foolish to repeat the same things
so often. I must leave you, and
think no more on you. I even
think that I shall not write to you
again. Am I under any obligation
to render you an exact account of
all I do?</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">CONSIDERE</span>, mon amour,
jusqu’à quel excez tu as
manqué de preuoyance. Ah
mal-heureux! tu as esté
trahy, &amp; tu m’as trahie
par des esperances trompeuses. Vne
passion sur laquelle tu auois fait tant
de projets de plaisirs, ne te cause
presentement qu’vn mortel desespoir,
qui ne peut estre comparé qu’à la
cruauté de l’absence, qui le cause.
Quoy? cette absence, à laquelle ma
douleur, toute ingenieuse qu’elle est, ne
peut donner vn nom assez funeste, me
priuera donc pour toujours de regarder
ces yeux, dans lesquels je voyois tāt
d’amour, &amp; qui me faisoient connoître
des mouuemēs, qui me combloient de
joye, qui me tenoient lieu de toutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
choses, &amp; qui enfin me suffisoient?
Helas! les miens sont priuez de la seule
lumiere, qui les animoit, il ne leur reste
que des larmes &amp; je ne les ay employez
à aucun vsage, qu’à pleurer sans cesse,
depuis que j’appris que vous estiez enfin
resolu à vn éloignement, qui m’est si
insupportable, qu’il me fera mourir en
peu de temps. Cependant il me semble
que j’ay quelque attachement pour des
malheurs, dont vous estes la seule cause:
Ie vous ay destiné ma vie aussi-tost que
je vous ay veu; &amp; je sens quelque
plaisir en vous la sacrifiant. I’ enuoye
mille fois le jour mes soupirs vers vous,
ils vous cherchent en tous lieux, &amp; ils
ne me rapportent pour toute recompense
de tant d’inquietudes, qu’vn aduertissement
trop sincere, que me dōne ma
mauuaise fortune, qui a la cruauté de ne
souffrir pas, que je me flatte, &amp; qui me
dit à tous momens; Cesse, cesse Mariane
infortunée de te consumer vainement:
&amp; de chercher vn Amant que tu ne
verras iamais; qui a passé les Mers
pour te fuir, qui est en France au milieu
des plaisirs, qui ne pense pas vn seul
moment à tes douleurs, &amp; qui te dispense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
de tous ces transports, desquels il ne te
sçait aucun gré? mais non, je ne puis
me resoudre à juger si injurieusement de
vous, &amp; je suis trop interessée à vous
justifier: Ie ne veux point m’imaginer
que vous m’auez oubliée. Ne fuis-je
pas assez malheureuse sans me tourmenter
par de faux soupçons? Et pourquoy
ferois-je des efforts pour ne me plus
souuenir de tous les soins, que vous
auez pris de me temoigner de l’amour?
I’ay esté si charmée de tous ces soins,
que je serois bien ingrate, si je ne vous
aymois auec les mesmes emportemens,
que ma Passion me donnoit, quand je
joüissois des témoignages de la vostre.
Comment se peut-il faire que les souuenirs
des momens si agreables, soient deuenus
si cruels? &amp; faut-il que contre leur
nature, ils ne seruent qu’à tyranniser
mon cœur? Helas! vostre derniere
lettre le reduisit en vn estrange état: il
eut des mouuemens si sensibles qu’il fit,
ce semble, des efforts, pour se separer de
moy, &amp; pour vous aller trouuer: Ie fus si
accablée de toutes ces émotions violentes,
que je demeuray plus de trois heures
abandonnée de tous mes sens: je me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
défendis de reuenir à vne vie que je dois
perdre pour vous: puis que je ne puis la
cōnserver pour vous, je reuis enfin, malgré
moy la lumiere, je me flatois de sentir
que je mourois d’amour; &amp; d’ailleurs
j’estois bien-aise de n’estre plus exposée à
voir mon cœur déchiré par la douleur de
vostre absence. Apres ces accidens, j’ay
eu beaucoup de differētes indispositions:
mais, puis-je jamais estre sans maux,
tant que je ne vous verray pas? Ie les
supporte cependant sans murmurer, puis
qu’ils viennent de vous. Quoy? est-ce
là la recompēse, que vous me donnez,
pour vous auoir si tendrement aymé?
Mais il n’importe, je suis resoluë à vous
adorer toute ma vie, &amp; à ne voir jamais
personne; &amp; je vous asseure que vous
ferez bien aussi de n’aymer personne.
Pourriez vous estre content d’vne Passion
moins ardente que la miēne? Vous
trouuerez, peut-estre, plus de beauté
(vous m’auez pourtant dit autrefois, que
j’estois assez belle) mais vous ne trouuerez
jamais tant d’amour, &amp; tout le reste n’est
rien. Ne remplissez plus vos lettres de
choses inutiles, &amp; ne m’escriuez plus de
me souuenir de vous? Ie ne puis vous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
oublier, &amp; je n’oublie pas aussi, que vous
m’auez fait esperer, que vous viēdriez
passer quelque temps auec moy. Helas!
pourquoy n’y voulez vous pas passer
toute vostre vie? S’il m’estoit possible
de sortir de ce malheureux Cloistre, je
n’attendrois pas en Portugal l’effet de
vos promesses: j’irois, sans garder aucune
mesure, vous chercher, vous suiure, &amp;
vous aymer par tout le monde: je n’ose
me flater que cela puisse estre, je ne
veux point nourrir vne esperance, qui
me donneroit asseurément quelque plaisir,
&amp; je ne veux plus estre sensible qu’aux
douleurs. I’auouë cependant que l’occasion,
que mon frere m’a donnée de vous
escrire, a surpris en moy quelques mouuemens
de joye, &amp; qu’elle a suspendu pour
vn moment le desespoir, où je suis. Ie
vous coniure de me dire, pourquoy vous
vous estes attaché à m’enchanter, comme
vous auez fait, puisque vous sçauiez bien
que vous deuiez m’abandonner? Et
pourquoy auez vous esté si acharné à me
rendre malheureuse? que ne me laissiez
vous en repos dans mon Cloistre? vous
auois-ie fait quelque iniure? Mais ie
vous demande pardon: ie ne vous im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>pute
rien: ie ne suis pas en estat de
penser à ma vengeance, &amp; i’accuse seulement
la rigueur de mon Destin. Il me
semble qu’en nous separant, il nous a fait
tout le mal, que nous pouuiōs craindre;
il ne sçauroit separer nos cœurs; l’amour
qui est plus puissant que luy, les a vnis
pour toute nostre vie. Si vous prenez
quelque interest à la mienne, escriuez
moy souuent. Ie merite bien que vous
preniez quelque soin de m’apprendre
l’estat de vostre cœur, &amp; de vostre fortune,
sur tout venez me voir. Adieu, ie
ne puis quitter ce papier, il tombera
entre vos mains, ie voudrois bien auoir
le mesme bon-heur: Helas! insensée
que ie suis, ie m’apperçois bien que cela
n’est pas possible. Adieu, ie n’en puis
plus. Adieu, aymez moy toûjours; &amp;
faites moy souffrir encore plus de maux.</p>

aux sentimēs de mon cœur,
de tascher de vous les faire

qu’il meritoit plus de fidelité, qu’on n’en

vous auez à me trahir, l’emporte enfin
sur la justice, que vous deuez à tout ce

&amp; ie voudrois tout deuoir à vostre seule

preuoir que mes plaisirs finiroient plûtost
que mon amour? pouuois-ie esperer,
que vous demeureriez toute vostre vie en
Portugal, &amp; que vous renonceriez à vostre
fortune &amp; à vostre Pays, pour ne penser
qu’à moy? mes douleurs ne peuuent
receuoir aucun soulagement, &amp; le souuenir
de mes plaisirs me comble de desespoir:
Quoy! tous mes desirs seront donc inutiles,

chambre avec toute l’ardeur, &amp; tout
l’emportement, que vous me faisiez voir?
mais helas! je m’abuse, &amp; je ne connois
que trop, que tous les mouuemens, qui
occupoient ma teste, &amp; mon cœur,
n’estoient excitez en vous, que par quelques
plaisirs, &amp; qu’ils finissoient aussi-tost
qu’eux; il falloit que dans ces
momens trop heureux j’appellasse ma
raison à mon secours pour moderer
l’excez funeste de mes delices, &amp; pour
m’annoncer tout ce que ie souffre presentement:
mais ie me donnois toute à
vous, &amp; ie n’estois pas en estat de penser
à ce qui eût pû empoisonner ma ioye, &amp;

témoignages ardens de vostre passion; ie
m’apperceuois trop agreablement que
i’estois auec vous pour penser que vous
seriez vn iour éloigné de moy: ie me
souuiens pourtant de vous auoir dit quelquefois
que vous me rendriez malheureuse:
mais ces frayeurs estoient bien-tost
dissipées, &amp; ie prenois plaisir, à vous les
sacrifier, &amp; à m’abandonner à l’enchantement,

remède; non i’ayme mieux souffrir
encore dauantage, que vous oublier.
Helas! cela dépend il de moy? Ie ne
puis me reprocher d’auoir souhaité vn
seul moment de ne vous plus aymer:
vous estes plus à plaindre; que je ne suis,
&amp; il vaut mieux souffrir tout ce que je
souffre, que de ioüir des plaisirs languisans,

de France: ie n’enuie point vostre

vous défie de m’oublier entierement:
Ie me flatte de vous auoir mis en estat de
n’auoir sans moy, que des plaisirs imparfaits,
&amp; ie suis plus heureuse que vous,
puisque ie suis plus occupée. L’on m’a
fait depuis peu Portiere en ce Conuent:
tous ceux qui me parlent, croyent que
ie sois fole, ie ne sçay ce que ie leur
répons: Et il faut que les Religieuses
soyent aussi insensées que moy, pour
m’auoir crû capable de quelque soin.
Ah! i’enuie le bon-heur d’Emanuel,

i’ay fait pour vous contre toute sorte de

où vous estes venu tant de fois, &amp; ie
regarde sans cesse vôtre portrait, qui

qu’on est beaucoup plus heureux, &amp;
qu’on sent quelque chose de bien plus
touchant, quand on ayme violamment,
que lors’qu’on est aymé. Ie ne sçay, ny
ce que ie suis, ny ce que ie fais, ny ce
que ie desire: ie suis deschirée par mille
mouuemens contraires: Peut-on s’imaginer
vn estat si deplorable? Ie vous
ayme éperduëment, &amp; ie vous mesnage
assez pour n’oser, peut-estre, souhaiter que
vous soyez agité des mesmes transports:
ie me tuërois, ou ie mourrois de douleur
sans me tuër, si j’estois asseurée que vous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
n’auez jamais aucun repos, que vostre
vie n’est que trouble, &amp; qu’agitation, que
vous pleurez sans cesse, &amp; que tout vous
est odieux; je ne puis suffire à mes
maux, comment pourrois-je supporter la
douleur, que me donneroient les vostres,
qui me seroient mille fois plus sensibles?
Cependant ie ne puis aussi me resoudre
à desirer que vous ne pensiez point à
moy; &amp; à vous parler sincerement, ie
suis ialouse auec fureur de tout ce qui
vous donne de la joye, &amp; qui touche
vostre cœur, &amp; vostre goust en France.
Ie ne sçay pourquoy ie vous écris, ie voy
bien que vous aurez seulement pitié de
moy, &amp; ie ne veux point de vostre pitié;
j’ay bien du depit cōtre moy-mesme,
quand ie sais reflexion sur tout ce que ie
vous ay sacrifié: j’ay perdu ma reputation,
je me suis exposée a la fureur de
mes parens, à la severité des loix de ce
Païs contre les Religieuses, &amp; à vostre
ingratitude, qui me paroist le plus
grand de tous les malheurs: cependant
je sens bien que mes remors ne
sont pas veritables, que ie voudrois du
meilleur de mon cœur, auoir couru pour
l’amour de vous de plus grans dangers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
&amp; que i’ay vn plaisir funeste d’auoir
hazardé ma vie &amp; mō honneur, tout ce
que i’ay de plus precieux, ne devoit-il
pas estre en vostre disposition? Et ne
dois-je pas estre bien aise de l’auoir
employé, comme i’ay fait: il me semble
mesme que ie ne suis gueres contente ny
de mes douleurs, ny de l’excez de mon
amour, quoi que ie ne puisse, helas! me
flater assez pour étre contente de vous;
je vis, infidelle que ie suis, &amp; ie fais
autant de choses pour conserver ma vie,
que pour la perdre, Ah! j’en meurs de
honte: mon desespoir n’est donc que
dans mes Lettres? Si je vous aimois
autant que ie vous l’ay dit mille fois,
ne serois-je pas morte, il y a long-temps?
Ie vous ay trompé, c’est à vous à vous
plaindre de moy: Helas! pourquoy
ne vous en plaignez vous pas? Ie vous
ay veu partir, ie ne puis esperer de vous
voir iamais de retour, &amp; ie respire cependant:
ie vous ay trahy, ie vous en
demande pardon: mais ne me l’accordez
pas? Traittez moy seueremēt? Ne
trouuez point que mes sentimens soient
assez violens? Soyez plus difficile à
contēter? Mandez moy que vo’ voulez<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
que ie meure d’amour pour vous? Et
ie vous conjure de me donner ce secours,
afin que ie surmonte la foiblesse de mon
sexe, &amp; que ie finisse toutes mes irresolutions
par vn veritable desespoir; vne fin
tragique vo’ obligeroit sans doute à
penser souuent à moy, ma memoire vous
seroit chere, &amp; vous seriez, peut-estre,
sensiblement touché d’vne mort extraordinaire,
ne vaut-elle pas mieux que
l’estat, où vous m’auez reduite? Adieu,
ie voudrois bien ne vous auoir iamais
veu. Ah! ie sens viuement la fausseté
de ce sentiment, &amp; ie connois dans le
moment que ie vous écris, que i’aime
bien mieux estre malheureuse en vo’
aimant, que de ne vous auoir iamais
veu; je consens donc sans murmure à
ma mauuaise destinée, puisque vous
n’auez pas voulu la rendre meilleure.
Adieu, promettez, moy de me regretter
tendrement, si ie meurs de douleur, &amp;
qu’au moins la violence de ma Passion
vous donne du dégoust &amp; de l’éloignement
pour toutes choses; cette consolation
me suffira, &amp; s’il faut que ie vous
abandonne pour toûjours, ie voudrois
bien ne vous laisser pas à vne autre.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Ne seriez vous pas bien cruel de vous
seruir de mon desespoir, pour vous rendre
plus aimable, &amp; pour faire voir, que vous
auez donné la plus grande Passion du
monde? Adieu encore vne fois, ie vous
écris des lettres trop longues, je n’ay
pas assez d’égard pour vous, ie vous en
demande pardon, &amp; j’ose esperer que
vous aurez quelque indulgence pour vne
pauure insensée, qui ne l’estoit pas,
comme vous sçauez, auant qu’elle vous
aimât. Adieu, il me semble que ie vous
parle trop souuent de l’estat insuportable
où ie suis: cependant ie vous remercie
dans le fonds de mon cœur du desespoir,
que vous me causez, &amp; ie deteste la
tranquillité, où j’ay vescu, auant que
je vous connusse. Adieu, ma Passion
augmente à chaque moment. Ah! que
j’ay de choses à vous dire.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">VO</span>stre Lieutenant vient de me
dire, qu’vne tempeste vous
a obligé de relascher au
Royaume d’Algarve: je
crains que vous n’ayez beaucoup
souffert sur la mer, &amp; cette apprehension
m’a tellement occupée; que je n’ay
plus pensé à tous mes maux, estes vous
bien persuadé que vostre Lieutenant
prenne plus de part que moy à tout ce qui
vous arriue? Pourquoy en est-il mieux informé,
&amp; enfin pourquoi ne m’auez vous
point écrit? Ie suis bien malheureuse,
si vous n’en aués trouué aucune occasion
depuis vostre depart, &amp; ie la suis bien
dauantage, si vous en aués trouué sans
m’écrire; vostre injustice &amp; vostre ingratitude
sont extrémes: mais ie serois au
desespoir, si elles vous attiroient quelque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>

qu’elles demeurent sans punition, que si
j’en estois vangeé: je resiste à toutes les
apparences, qui me deuroient persuader,
que vous ne m’aimés gueres, &amp; ie sens
bien plus de disposition à m’abandonner
aueuglement à ma Passion, qu’aux raisons,
que vo’ me donnez de me plaindre de
vostre peu de soin: que vous m’auriés
épargné d’inquietudes, si vostre procedé
eust esté aussi languissant les premiers
jours, que je vous vis, qu’il m’a parû
depuis quelque temps! mais qui n’auroit
esté abuseé, comme moy, par tant d’empressement,
&amp; à qui n’eussent-ils paru
sinceres? Qu’on a de peine à se resoudre
à soupçonner longtemps la bonne foy de
ceux qu’on aime! ie voy bien que la
moindre excuse vous suffit, &amp; sans que
vous preniez le soin de m’en faire, l’amour
que i’ay pour vous, vous sert si fidelemēt,
que ie ne puis consentir à vo’ trouuer
coupable, que pour joüir du sensible
plaisir de vous justifier moy-même. Vous
m’auez consommée par vos assiduitez,
vous m’auez enflamée par vos transports,
vo’ m’auez charmée par vos complaisances,
vous m’auez asseurée par vos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
sermens, mon inclinatiō violente m’a
seduite, &amp; les suites de ces commencemēs
si agreables, &amp; si heureux ne sont que
des larmes, que des soûpirs, &amp; qu’vne
mort funeste, sans que ie puisse y porter
aucun remede. Il est vray que i’ay eu
des plaisirs bien surprenans en vous
aimant: mais ils me coustent d’estranges
douleurs, &amp; tous les mouuemēs, que vous
me causez, sont extrémes. Si i’auois
resisté auec opiniâtreté à vostre amour, si
je vous auois donné quelque sujet de
chagrin, &amp; de jalousie pour vous enflamer
dauantage, si vous auiez remarqué
quelque mesnagement artificieux dans
ma conduite, si i’auois enfin voulu
opposer ma raison à l’inclination naturelle
que j’ay pour vous, dont vo’ me
fistes bien-tost apperceuoir (quoy que
mes efforts eussent esté sans doute
inutiles) vous pourriez me punir seuerement,
&amp; vous seruir de vostre pouuoir:
mais vous me parustes aimable, auant
que vous m’eussiez dit, que vous m’aimiez,
vous me témoignastes vne grande Passion,
j’en fûs rauie, &amp; ie m’abandonnay à vous
aimer éperduëment, vous n’estiés point
aueuglé, comme moy, pour-quoy aués<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
vo’ donc souffert que ie deuinsse en l’estat
où ie me trouue? qu’est-ce que vous
vouliez faire de tous mes emportemens,
qui ne pouuoient vous estre que tres-importuns?
Vous sçauiez bien que vous
ne seriez pas toûjours en Portugal, &amp;
pourquoy m’y aués vous voulu choisir
pour me rendre si malheureuse, vous
eussiés trouué sans doute en ce Païs
quelque femme qui eust esté plus belle,
auec laquelle vous eussiés eu autant de
plaisir, puisque vous n’en cherchiés que
de grossiers, qui vo’ eut fidelement aimé
aussi long-temps qu’elle vous eut veu,
que le temps eust pû consoler de vostre
absence, &amp; que vous auriés pû quitter
sans perfidie, &amp; sans cruauté: ce procedé
est biē plus d’vn Tyran, attaché à persecuter,
que d’vn Amant, qui ne doit penser
qu’à plaire; Helas! Pourquoy exercés
vous tant de rigueur sur vn cœur, qui est
à vous? Ie voy bien que vous estes
aussi facile à vous laisser persuader contre
moy, que ie l’ay esté à me laisser persuader
en vostre faueur; j’aurois resisté,
sans auoir besoin de tout mon amour, &amp;
sans m’apperceuoir que j’eusse rien fait
d’extraordinaire, à de plus grandes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
raisons, que ne peuuēt estre celles, qui vo’
ont obligé à me quitter: elles m’eussent
parû bien foibles, &amp; il n’y en a point,
qui eussent jamais pû m’arracher d’aupres
de vous: mais vous aués voulu profiter
des pretextes, que vous aués trouués de
retourner en Frāce; vn vaisseau partoit,
que ne le laissiés vous partir? vostre
famille vous auoit escrit, ne sçaués
vous pas toutes les persecutions, que
j’ay souffertes de la mienne? Vostre
hōneur vous engageoit à m’abandonner,
ay-je pris quelque soin du mien? Vous
estiés obligé d’aller seruir vostre Roy, si
tout ce qu’on dit de luy, est vray, il n’a
aucun besoin de vostre secours, &amp; il vous
auroit excusé; j’eusse esté trop heureuse,
si nous auions passé nostre vie ensemble:
mais puisqu’il falloit qu’vne absence
cruelle nous separât, il me semble que je
dois estre bien aise de n’auoir pas esté
infidele, &amp; ie ne voudrois pas pour toutes
les choses du mōde, auoir commis vne
action si noire: Quoy! vous auez connu le
fonds de mon cœur, &amp; de ma tendresse, &amp;
vous auez pû vous resoudre à me laisser
pour iamais, &amp; à m’exposer aux frayeurs,
que ie dois auoir, que vous ne vous souue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>nez
plus de moy, que pour me sacrifier à
vne nouuelle Passion? Ie voy bien que
ie vous aime, comme vne folle: cependant
ie ne me plains point de toute la
violence des mouuemens de mō cœur,
ie m’accoustume à ses persecutions, &amp; ie
ne pourrois viure sans vn plaisir, que ie
descouure, &amp; dont ie joüis en vous aimāt
au milieu de mille douleurs: mais ie
suis sans cesse persecutée auec un extréme
desagréemēt par la haine, &amp; par
le dégoustt que j’ay pour toutes choses;
ma famille, mes amis &amp; ce Conuent me
sont insuportables; tout ce que ie suis
obligeé de voir, et tout ce qu’il faut
que ie fasse de toute necessité, m’est
odieux: je suis si jalouse de ma Passion,
qu’il me semble que toutes mes actions,
&amp; que tous mes deuoirs vous regardent:
Oüy, ie fais quelque scrupule, si ie
n’employe tous les momens de ma vie
pour vous; que ferois-je, helas! sans
tant de haine, &amp; sans tant d’amour, qui
remplissent mon cœur? Pourrois-je
surviure à ce qui m’occupe incessamment,
pour mener vne vie tranquille &amp;
languissante? Ce vuide &amp; cette insensibilité
ne peuuent me conuenir. Tout le<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
monde s’est apperceu du changement
entier de mon humeur, de mes manieres,
&amp; de ma persōne, ma Mere m’en a parlé
auec aigreur, &amp; ensuite auec quelque
bonté, ie ne sçay ce que ie luy ay
répondu, il me semble que ie luy ay
tout auoüé. Les Religieuses les plus
seueres ont pitié de l’estat où je suis, il
leur donne mesme quelque consideration,
&amp; quelque menagemēt pour moy; tout
le monde est touché de mon amour. &amp;
vo’ demeurez dans vne profonde indiference,
sans m’escrire, que des lettres
froides; pleines de redites; la moitié
du papier n’est pas remply, &amp; il paroist
grossierement que vous mourez d’enuie
de les auoir acheuées. Dona Brites me
persecuta ces jours passez pour me faire
sortir de ma chambre, &amp; croyant me
diuertir, elle me mena promener sur le
Balcon, d’où l’on voit Mertola, je la
suiuis, &amp; je fûs aussi-tost frapée d’vn
souuenir cruel, qui me fit pleurer tout le
reste du jour: elle me ramena, &amp; ie me
jettay sur mon lict, où ie fis mille réflexions
sur le peu d’apparence, que ie
voy de guerir jamais: ce qu’on fait pour
me soulager, aigrit ma douleur, &amp; ie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
trouue dans les remedes mesmes des
raisons particulieres de m’afliger: je
vous ay veu souuent passer en ce lieu
auec vn air, qui me charmoit, &amp; j’estois
sur ce Balcon le jour fatal, que ie cōmençay
à sentir les premiers effets de
ma Passion malheureuse: il me sembla
que vous vouliez me plaire, quoy que
vous ne me connussiez pas: je me persuaday
que vous m’auiez remarquée
entre toutes celles, qui estoient auec
moy, ie m’imaginay que lors que vous
vous arrestiez, vous estiez bien aise, que
ie vous visse mieux, &amp; i’admirasse vostre
adresse, &amp; vostre bonne grace, lors que vous
poussiez vôtre cheual, i’estois surprise de
quelque frayeur, lors que vous le faisiez
passer dans vn endroit difficile: enfin je
m’interessois secrettement à toutes vos
actions, je sentois bien que vous ne
m’estiez point indifferent, &amp; ie prenois
pour moy tout ce que vous faisiez: vous
ne connoissez que trop les suites de ces
commencemens, &amp; quoy que ie n’aye
rien à mesnager, ie ne dois pas vous les
escrire, de crainte de vous rendre plus
coupable, s’il est possible que vous ne
l’estes, &amp; d’auoir à me reprocher tant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
d’efforts inutiles pour vous obliger à
m’estre fidele, vous ne le serez point:
Puis-je esperer de mes lettres &amp; de mes
reproches ce que mon amour &amp; mon
abandonnement n’ont pû sur vostre ingratitude?
Ie fuis trop asseurée de mon malheur,
vostre procedé injuste ne me laisse
pas la moindre raison d’en douter, &amp;
ie dois tout apprehender, puisque vous
m’auez abandonée. N’aurez vous de
charmes que pour moy, &amp; ne paroistrez
vous pas agreable à d’autres yeux? Ie
croy que ie ne seray pas fâchée que les
sentimens des autres iustifient les miens
en quelque façon, &amp; ie voudrois que toutes
les femmes de France vous trouuassent
aimable, qu’aucune ne vous aimât, &amp;
qu’aucune ne vous plût: ce projet est
ridicule, &amp; impossible: neantmoins j’ay
assez éprouué que vous n’estes gueres
capable d’vn grand entestement, &amp; que
vous pourrez bien m’oublier sans aucun
secours, &amp; sans y estre contraint par vne
nouuelle Passion: peut-estre, voudrois-je
que vous eussiez quelque pretexte
raisonnable? Il est vray, que ie serois
plus malheureuse, mais vous ne seriez pas
si coupable: je voy bien que vovs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
demeurerez en Frāce sans de grands
plaisirs, auec vne entiere liberté; la
fatigue d’vn long voyage, quelque petite
bien-seance, &amp; la crainte de ne répondre
pas à mes transports, vous retiennent:
Ah! ne m’apprehendez point? Ie me
contenteray de vous voir de temps en
temps, &amp; de sçauoir seulement que no’
sommes en mesme lieu: mais ie me flatte,
peut-estre, &amp; vous serez plus touché de la
rigueur &amp; de la seuerité d’vne autre, que
vous ne l’auez esté de mes faueurs; est-il
possible que vous serez enflammé par
de mauuais traittemens? Mais auant
que de vous engager dans vne grande
Passion, pensez bien à l’excez de mes
douleurs, à l’incertitude de mes projets,
à la diuersité de mes mouuemens, à
l’extrauagance de mes Lettres, à mes
confiances, à mes desespoirs, à mes
souhaits, à ma jalousie? Ah! vous
allez vous rendre malheureux; je vous
conjure de profiter de l’estat où ie suis,
&amp; qu’au moins ce que ie souffre pour
vous, ne vous soit pas inutile? Vous me
fites, il y a cinq ou six mois vne fascheuse
confidēce, &amp; vo’ m’auoüâtes de trop
bonne foy, que vous auiez aimé vne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Dame en vostre Païs: si elle vous empesche
de reuenir, mādez-le moy sans
ménagement? afin que ie ne languisse
plus? quelque reste d’esperance me
soustiēt encore, &amp; ie seray bien aise (si
elle ne doit auoir aucune suite) de la
perdre tout à fait, &amp; de me perdre moy-mesme;
enuoyez moy son portrait auec
quelqu’vne de ses Lettres? Et escriuez
moy tout ce qu’elle vous dit? I’y trouuerois,
peut-estre, des raisons de me
consoler, ou de m’affliger dauantage, ie
ne puis demeurer plus long-temps dās
l’estat où ie suis, &amp; il n’y a point de
chāgement, qui ne me soit fauorable:
Ie voudrois aussi auoir le portrait de
vostre frere &amp; de vostre Belle-sœur: tout
ce qui vous est quelque chose, m’est fort
cher, &amp; ie suis entierement deuoüée à ce
qui vous touche: je ne me suis laissé
aucune disposition de moy-mesme; Il y
a des momens, où il me semble que
j’aurois affez de soûmission pour seruir
celle, que vous aimez; vos mauuais
traittemēs, &amp; vos mépris m’ont tellement
abatuë, que ie n’ose quelque fois penser
seulement, qu’il me semble que ie pourrois
estre jalouse sans vous déplaire, &amp; que<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
ie croy auoir le plus grand tort du
monde de vous faire des reproches: je
suis souuent conuaincuë, que ie ne dois
point vous faire voir auec fureur, comme
ie fais, des sentimens, que vo’ desauoüez.
Il y a long-temps qu’vn Officier attend
vostre Lettre, i’auois resolu de l’escrire
d’vne maniere à vo’ la faire receuoir
sans dégoust: mais elle est trop extrauagante,
il faut la finir: Helas! il n’est
pas en mon pouuoir de m’y resoudre, il
me semble que je vous parle, quand ie
vous escris, &amp; que vous m’estes vn peu
plus present; La premiere ne sera pas si
longue, ny si importune, vous pourrez
l’ouurir &amp; la lire sur l’asseurance, que ie
vous donne, il est vray que ie ne dois
point vous parler d’vne passion, qui vous
déplaist, &amp; ie ne vous en parleray plus.
Il y aura vn an dans peu de jours que ie
m’abandonnay toute à vous sans ménagement:
vostre Passion me paroissoit fort
ardente, &amp; fort sincere, &amp; ie n’eusse
jamais pensé que mes faueurs vo’ eussent
assez rebuté, pour vous obliger à faire
cinq cens lieuës, &amp; à vous exposer à des
naufrages, pour vo’ en éloigner; personne
ne m’estoit redeuable d’vn pareil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
traittement: vous pouuez vous souuenir
de ma pudeur, de ma confusion &amp; de
mon desordre, mais vous ne vous souuenez
pas de ce qui vous engageroit à
m’aimer malgré vous. L’Officier, qui
doit vous porter cette Lettre, me mande
pour la quatrième fois, qu’il veut partir,
qu’il est pressant, il abandonne sans doute
quelque malheureuse en ce Païs. Adieu,
j’ay plus de peine à finir ma Lettre, que
vo’ n’en auez eu à me quitter, peut-estre,
pour toûjours. Adieu, ie n’ose vous
donner mille noms de tendresse, ny
m’abandonner sans cōtrainte à tous mes
mouuemens: ie vo’ aime mille fois plus
que ma vie, &amp; mille fois plus que ie ne
pense; que vous m’estes cher! &amp; que
vous m’estes cruel! vous ne m’escriuez
point, ie n’ay pû m’empescher de vo’ dire
encore cela; je vay recommencer, &amp;
l’Officier partira; qu’importe, qu’il parte,
j’écris plus pour moy, que pour vous, ie
ne cherche qu’à me soulager, aussi bien
la longueur de ma lettre vous fera peur,
vous ne la lirez point qu’est-ce que
j’ay fait pour estre si malheureuse?
Et pourquoy auez vous empoisonné
ma vie? Que ne suis-je née en vn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
autre Païs. Adieu, pardonnez moy?
Ie n’ose plus vous prier de m’aimer;
voyez où mon destin m’a reduite?

Ne craignez pas que je vous écriue; je ne
mettray pas mesme vostre nom audessus
du pacquet; j’ay chargé de tout ce
détail Dona Brites, que j’auois accoustumée
à des confidences bien éloignées

ie me flattois de n’estre plus attachée à
vous: Mais on vient about de tout ce
qu’on veut, auec tant de raisons: Ie les
ay mises entre les mains de Dona Brites;
que cette resolution ma cousté de larmes!
Apres mille mouuements &amp; milles incertitudes
que vous ne connoissez pas, &amp;
dont ie ne vous rendray pas compte
assurement. Ie l’ay coniurée de ne m’en
parler iamais, de ne me les rēdre iamais,
quand mesme ie les demanderois pour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
les reuoir encore vne fois, &amp; de vous les
renuoyer, enfin, sans m’en aduertir.</p>

<p>Ie n’ay bien connû l’excés de mon
Amour que depuis que i’ay voulu faire
to’ mes efforts pour m’en guerir, &amp; ie
crains que ie n’eusse osé l’entreprendre,
si i’eusse pû préuoir tant de difficultées &amp;
tant de violences. Ie suis persuadée
que j’eusse senti des mouuemens moins
desagreables en vo’ aymant tout ingrat
qve vous estes, qu’en vous quittant pour
tousiours. I’ay éprouué que vous m’estiez
moins cher que ma passion, &amp; j’ay eu
d’estranges peines à la combattre, apres
que vos procedés iniurieux m’ont rendu
vostre personne odieuse.</p>

<p>L’orgueil ordinaire de mon sexe ne
m’a point aydé à prendre des resolutions
contre vous; Helas! j’ay souffert vos
mepris, j’eusse supporté vôtre haisne &amp;
toute la jalousie que m’eust dōné l’attachement
que vous eussiez peu auoir
pour vn autre, j’aurois eu, au moins
quelque passion à combattre, mais vostre
indifference m’est insupportable; vos
impertinantes protestations d’amitié, &amp;
les ciuilités ridicules de vostre derniere
lettre, m’ōt fait voir que vous auiez receu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
toutes celles que je vous ay écrites,
qu’elles n’ont causé dans vostre cœur
aucun mouuement, &amp; que cependant
vous les auez luës: Ingrat, je suis
encore assez folle pour estre au desespoir
de ne pouuoir me flatter qu’elles ne
soient pas venuës jusques à vous, &amp;
qu’on ne vous les aye pas renduës; Ie
deteste vostre bonne foy, vous auois-je
prié de me māder sinceremēt la verité,
que ne me laissiez vous ma passion;
vous n’auiez qu’à ne me point écrire; ie
ne cherchois pas à estre éclaircie; ne
suis-je pas bien malheureuse de n’auoir
pû vous obliger à prēdre quelque soin
de me tromper? &amp; de n’estre plus en
estat de vous excuser. Sçachez que je
m’aperçois que vous estes indigne de
tous mes sentimens, &amp; que je connois
toutes vous méchantes qualitez: Cependāt
(si tout ce que j’ay fait pour
vous peut meriter que vous ayez quelque
petits égards pour les graces que ie
vous demande) je vous coniure de ne
m’écrire plus, &amp; de m’ayder à vous
oublier entierement, si vous me témoigniez
foiblement, mesme, que vous auez
eu quelque peine en lisāt cette lettre, je<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
vo’ croirois peut-estre; &amp; peut-estre
aussi vostre adueu &amp; vôtre consentement
me donneroient du dépit &amp; de la colere,
&amp; tout cela pourroit m’enflamer: Ne
vous meslez donc point de ma conduite,
vous renuerseriez, sans doute,
tous mes proiets, de quelque maniere que
vous voulussiez y entrer; je ne veux
point sçauoir le succés de cette lettre;
ne troublés pas l’estat que ie me prepare,
il me semble que vous pouuez estre content
des maux que vous me causés
(quelque dessein que vous eussiez fait de
me rendre mal’heureuse): Ne m’ostez
point de mon incertitude; i’espere que
j’en feray, auec le temps, quelque chose
de tranquille: Ie vous promets de ne
vous point hayr, ie me défie trop des
sentimens violents, pour oser l’entreprendre.
Ie suis persuadeé que ie trouuerois
peut-estre, en ce pays vn Amant
plus fidele &amp; mieux fait; mais helas!
qui pourra me donner de l’amour? la
passion d’vn autre m’occupera-t’elle? La
mienne a t’elle pû quelque chose sur
vous? N’éprouue-je pas qu’vn cœur
attendry n’oublie jamais ce qui l’a fait
apperceuoir des trāsports qu’il ne con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>noissoit
pas, &amp; dont il estoit capable;
que tous ses mouuemens sont attachés à
l’Idole qu’il s’est faite; que ses premieres
idées &amp; que ses premieres blessures ne
peuuent estre ny gueries ny effacées; que
toutes les passions qui s’offrent à son
secours &amp; qui font des efforts pour le
remplir &amp; pour le contenter, luy promettent
vainement vne sensibilité qu’il
ne retrouue plus, que tous les plaisirs
qu’il cherche sans aucune enuie de les
rencontrer, ne seruent qu’à luy faire bien
connoître que rien ne luy est si cher, que
le souuenir de ses douleurs. Pourquoy
m’auez vo’ fait connoître l’imperfectiō
&amp; le desagréement d’vn attachement qui
ne doit pas durer eternellement, &amp; les
mal-heurs qui suiuent vn amour violent,
lors qu’il n’est pas reciproque, &amp; pourquoy
vne inclinatiō aueugle &amp; vne cruelle
destineé s’attachent-elles, d’ordinaire, à
nous déterminer pour ceux qui seroient
sensibles pour quelque autre.</p>

<p>Quand mesme je pourrois esperer
quelque amusemēt dans vn nouuel engagement,
&amp; que je trouuerois quelqu’vn
de bonne foy, j’ay tant de pitié de moy-mesme,
que je ferois beaucoup de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
scrupule de mettre le dernier homme du
monde en l’estat où vous m’auez reduite,
&amp; quoy que je ne sois pas obligée à vous
ménager; je ne pourrois me resoudre à
exercer sur vous, vne vengeance si cruelle,
quand mesme elle dependeroit de moy,
par vn changement que je ne preuois pas.</p>

<p>Ie cherche dans ce moment à vous
excuser, &amp; je cōprend bien qu’vne Religieuse
n’est guere aymable d’ordinaire:
Cependant il semble que si on estoit
capable de raisons, dans les choix qu’on
fait, on deueroit plustost s’attacher à elles
qu’aux autres femmes, rien ne les empesche
de penser incessāment à leur
passion, elles ne sont point détourneés
par mille choses qui dissipent &amp; qui
occupent dans le monde, il me semble
qu’il n’est pas fort agreable de voir celles
qu’on ayme, tousiours distraites par mille
bagatelles, &amp; il faut auoir bien peu de
delicatesse, pour souffrir (sans en estre au
desespoir) qu’elles ne parlent que d’assembleés,
d’aiustements, &amp; de promenades;
on est sans cesse exposé à de nouuelles
jalousies; elles sont obligeés à des
égards, à des complaisances, à des conuersations:
qui peut s’asseurer qu’elles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
n’ont aucun plaisir dans toutes ces occasions,
&amp; qu’elles souffrent tousiours leurs
marys auec vn extrême dégoust, &amp; sans
aucun consentement; Ah! qu’elles doiuent
se défier d’vn Amant qui ne leur fait pas
rendre vn compte bien exact là dessus,
qui croit aisément &amp; sans inquietude ce
qu’elles luy disent, &amp; qui les voit auec
beaucoup de confiance &amp; de tranquilité
suietes à tous ces deuoirs: Mais je ne
pretens pas vous prouuer par de bonnes
raisons, que vous deuiez m’aymer; ce
sont de tres-méchans moyens, &amp; j’en
ay employé de beaucoup meilleurs qui
ne m’ont pas reüssi; je connois trop bien
mon destin pour tâcher à le surmonter;
je seray mal-heureuse toute ma vie; ne
l’éstois-je pas en vous voyāt tous les
iours, je mourois de frayeur que vous ne
me fussiez pas fidel, je voulois vous voir
à tous moments, &amp; cela n’estoit pas
possible, j’estois troubleé par le peril que
vous couriez en entrant dans ce Conuent;
ie ne viuois pas lors que vous estiez à
l’armée, i’estois au desespoir de n’estre pas
plus belle &amp; plus digne de vous, ie murmurois
contre la mediocrité de ma condition,
ie croyois souuēt que l’attachement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
que vous paroissiez auoir pour moy, vous
pourroit faire quelque tort, il me sembloit
que je ne vous aymois pas assez,
j’apprehendois pour vous la colere de
mes parents, &amp; j’estois enfin dans vn
estat aussi pitoyable qu’est celuy où je
suis presentement; si vous m’eussiez
donné quelques témoignages de vostre
passion depuis que vo’ n’estes plus en
Portugal; j’aurois fait tous mes efforts
pour en sortir, je me fusse déguisée pour
vo’ aller trouuer; helas! qu’est-ce que
je fusse deuenuë, si vous ne vous fussiez
plus souciée de moy, apres que j’eusse
esté en France; quel desordre? quel
égarement? quel cōble de honte pour
ma famille, qui m’est fort chere depuis
que je ne vous ayme plus. Vous voyez
bien que je cōnnois de sens froid qu’il
estoit possible que je fusse encore plus à
plaindre que ie ne suis; &amp; ie vous parle,
au moins, raisonnablement vne fois en
ma vie; que ma moderatiō vous plaira,
&amp; que vous serez content de moy; je ne
veux point le sçauoir, je vous ay desia
prié de ne m’écrire plus, &amp; je vous en
coniure encore.</p>

<p>N’auez vous jamais fait quelque re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>flexion
sur la maniere dont vous m’auez
traitée, ne pensez vous iamais que vous
m’auez plus d’obligation qu’à personne
du monde; je vous ay aymé comme
vne incensée; que de mépris j’ay eu
pour toutes choses! vostre procedé n’est
point d’vn honneste homme, il faut que
vous ayez eu pour moy de l’auersion
naturelle, puis que vous ne m’auez pas
aymée éperduëment; je me suis laissée
enchanter par des qualitez tres-mediocres,
qu’auez vous fait qui deust me
plaire? quel sacrifice m’auez vous fait?
n’auez vous pas cherché mille autres
plaisirs? auez vous renoncé au jeu, &amp; à
la chasse? n’estes vous pas parti le
premier pour aller à l’Armée? n’en estes-vous
pas reuenu apres tous les autres,
vous vous y estes exposé folement, quoy
que je vous eusse prié de vous ménager
pour l’amour de moy, vous n’auez point
cherché les moyens de vous establir en
Portugal? où vous estiez estimé; vne
lettre de vostre frere vous en a fait partir,
sans hesiter vn moment, &amp; n’ay-je pas
sçeu que durant le voyage vous auez
esté de la plus belle humeur du monde.
Il faut aduoüer que ie suis obligée à<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
vous haïr mortellement; ah! ie me suis
attirée tous mes mal-heurs: je vous ay
d’abord accoustumé à vne grande passion,
auec trop de bonne foy, &amp; il faut de
l’artifice pour se faire aymer, il faut
chercher auec quelque adresse les moyens
d’enflâmer, &amp; l’amour tout seul ne donne
point de l’amour, vous vouliez que ie
vous aymasse, &amp; comme vous auiez
formé ce dessein, il n’y a rien que vous
n’eussiez fait pour y paruenir, vous vous
fussiez mesme resolu à m’aymer, s’il eut
esté necessaire; mais vous auez connu
que vous pouuiez reussir dans vostre
entreprise sans passion, &amp; que vous n’en
auiez aucun besoin, quelle perfidie?
croyés vous auoir pû impunement me
tromper, si quelque hazard vous
r’amenoit en ce pays, ie vous declare
que ie vous liureray à la vengeance de
mes parents. I’ay vécu long-temps dans
vn abandonnement &amp; dans vne idolatrie
qui me donne de l’horreur, &amp; mon
remords me persecute auec vne rigueur
insupportable, ie sens viuement la honte
des crimes que vo’ m’auez fait commettre,
&amp; ie n’ay plus, helas! la passion
qui m’empeschoit d’en connoistre l’énor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>mité;
quand est-ce que mon cœur ne
sera plus dechiré? quand est-ce que ie
seray deliurée de cét embarras, cruel!
cependant je croy que ie ne vous
souhaitte point de mal, &amp; que je me
resouderois à consentir que vous fussiez
heureux; mais cōmēt pourrés vous l’estre
si vous aués le cœur biē fait; je veux
vous écrire vne autre Lettre, pour vous
faire voir que ie seray peut-estre plus
tranquille dans quelque tēps; que j’auray
de plaisir de pouuoir vous reprocher vos
procedés iniustes aprés que ie n’en seray
plus si viuement touchée, &amp; lors que ie
vous seray connoistre que ie vous
méprise, que ie parle auec beaucoup
d’indifference de vostre trahison; que
j’ay oublié tous mes plaisirs, &amp; toutes
mes douleurs, &amp; que ie ne me souuiens
de vous que lors que ie veux m’en
souuenir. Ie demeure d’accord que vous
auez de grands aduantages sur moy, &amp;
que vous m’auez donné vne passion qui
ma fait perdre la raison, mais vous deuez
en tirer peu de vanité; j’estois jeune,
j’estois credule, on m’auoit enfermée
dans ce convēt depuis mon enfance, ie
n’auois veu que des gens desagreables,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
je n’auois jamais entendu les loüanges
que vous me donniez incessamment, il
me sembloit que je vous deuois les
charmes, &amp; la beauté que vo’ me
trouuiez, &amp; dont vous me faisiez apperceuoir,
j’entendois dire du bien de vous,
tout le monde me parloit en vostre
faueur, vous faisiez tout ce qu’il falloit
pour me donner de l’amour; mais ie
suis, enfin, reuenuë de cét enchantement,
vous m’auez dōné de grands secours, &amp;
j’aduoüe que j’en auois vn extrême
besoin: En vous renuoyant vos lettres,
je garderay soigneusement les deux dernieres
que vous m’auez écrites, &amp; ie les
reliray encore plus souuent que ie n’ay
leu les premieres, afin de ne retomber
plus dans mes foiblesses, Ah! quelles
me coûtēt cher, &amp; que i’aurois esté
heureuse, si vous eussiez voulu souffrir
que ie vous eusse toûjours aimé. Ie
connois bien que ie suis encore vn peu
trop occupée de mes reproches &amp; de
vostre infidelité; mais souuenez-vous que
ie me suis promise vn estat plus paisible,
&amp; que j’y paruiendray, ou que ie prēdray
contre moy quelque resolution extrême,
que vous apprendrez sans beaucoup de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
déplaisir; mais ie ne veux plus rien de
vous, ie suis vne folle de redire les
mesmes choses si souuent, il faut vous
quitter &amp; ne penser plus à vous, ie croy
mesme que je ne vous écriray plus, suis-je
obligée de vous rendre vn compte
exact de to’ mes diuers mouuements.</p>

Artificial Pieces | perhaps of the Kind, | that is anywhere
Ex- | tant: Beside the Pe- | culiar Graces,
and | Felicities of that Lan-| guage; in the matter |
of an Amour, which | cannot be adopted | into any
other | Tongue without Ex- | tream Force, and
Affectation. There was | (it seems) an Intrigue | of
Love carry’d on | betwixt a French offi- | cer, and a
Nun in | Portugal. The Cava- | lier forsakes his
Mis- | tress, and Returns | for France. The La- |
dy expostulates the | Business in five Let- | ters of

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">DURING</span> the passage of the present
work through the press, Mr.
York Powell was fortunate
enough to acquire by purchase
in Oxford a book not mentioned
in any bibliographical dictionary, nor possessed
by any of the chief English libraries, containing
a translation into verse of the five Letters of the
Portuguese Nun. On account of the rarity of
the book, of which this is probably a unique
copy, as well as of the curious rendering of the
famous Letters, it seemed advisable to transcribe
here all that concerned the love-lorn Marianna,
which has therefore been done. It should
perhaps be mentioned that every inquiry as to
the author of this translation and the date of its
first edition has proved fruitless.</p>

the table is a lighted candle, rosary and ink-pot,
while the portrait of her lover hangs over some

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
